## Less email, fewer meetings and more time to do the work.

Without constant email or chat interruption, everyone on your team will have longer stretches of uniterrupted time to do the actual work they are paid to do in the first place!

## Everyone on the team is in control!

Nozbe Teams is not an app just for managers. Everyone on the team can focus on tasks they choose (priority view), respond to team easily (incoming view) and follow what's going on (activity view).

1. Priority.

Everyone has the agency to choose which tasks to focus on. Only 

2. Incoming.

Everyone can be responsive to the team while not being interrupted. Receive tasks from others, respond to comments, act on reminders, never miss a task's due date.

3. Activity.

See what's going on in the team. Follow the activity in the projects you care about. Choose where you want to give feedback to someone else on the team.
