## We make it so darn easy to share tasks!

With Nozbe you'll just stop sending emails or messages, you'll need fewer meetings and you'll finally have more time to do the work.

1. [No more internal emails or chat messages!](/nozbe.com/email/)

Once you start using Nozbe Teams and put everything into projects, tasks and comments, you will finally stop using email or chat to collaborate. In fact, Nozbe Teams is as easy to use as Email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram or Messangerâ€¦ but it's way more organized! Say goodbye to team chaos!

2. [Fewer and much better meetings!](/nozbe.com/meetings/)

With all projects and tasks accessible to everyone on every device and things clearly written out in task comments, you will not need as many meetings! And when these do happen, you'll have less to talk about as everything will be in Nozbe!

3. [So much more time for actual work!](/nozbe.com/trust/)

Without constant flood of emails, messages or meetings, everyone on your team will have longer stretches of uniterrupted time to do the actual work they are paid to do in the first place! This means a much higher Return On Investment (ROI) on everyone's time. People will deliver better results than ever!

## Everyone on the team is in control!

Your team is very busy? You've got 100s of projects on your plate? Not a problem for Nozbe Teams.

Thanks to our [task-based communication system](/nozbe.com/tasks/) everyone on your team can focus on tasks they choose (priority view), respond to team easily (incoming view) and follow what's going on (activity view).

### Priority view. What's important?

Easily choose which tasks to focus on. Just mark them with a star and get them done!

### Incoming. Where I'm needed?

How to strike a balance between being responsive to the team while not being interrupted? This view helps! Receive tasks from others, respond to comments, act on reminders, never miss a task's due date.

### Activity. What's going on?

See the big picture in your team. Follow the activity in the projects you care about. Choose where you want to give feedback to someone else on the team.

## Made with ðŸ’œ by an all-remote team that's been perfecting this system for the last 14 years!

Founded in 2007 by Michael Sliwinski, Nozbe is a small, 20+ all-remote team that's been obsessed with getting people and teams organized. We've been working from our homes in Europe, Asia and USA before it was cool. We're quite famous for our unorthodox way of working:

### [We use Nozbe to build Nozbe](/nozbe.com/guide/)

We practice what we preach. We use and keep perfecting our own app to make it better. We are obsessed about getting everything organized: the projects, the tasks and the comments.

### [We have no office. We all work from our homes](/nozbe.com/remote/)

That's why Nozbe Teams is so great for hybrid teams where not everyone works in an office. People ask us about the secret to our success, creativity and leadership? It's all thanks to efficient communication through tasks in Nozbe. We don't need to be in the same office to be on the same page! [We even publish a podcast about it!](/nozbe.com/nooffice/)

### [We celebrate Mighty Fridays.](/nozbe.com/friday)

We're world-famous for working on day-to-day stuff only from Mondays to Thursdays. Fridays are different. We do our weekly review and then everyone on the team is free to focus on their personal development. So Fridays are not technically free, butâ€¦
