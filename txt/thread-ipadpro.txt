# Ordered #iPhone or #AppleWatch from the #AppleEvent? Now, let's talk about the #iPad and why it's the most versatile computer ever.

My review after using the #iPadPro 13" (12.9" if you will) daily for the last 2 years. Here's why it's BETTER than any other Mac or PC:

## 💻 #iPadPro with #MagicKeyboard is a perfect laptop!

It's very portable. The Magic Keyboard after 2 years is NOT worn out, I'm using it to type these words right now. It's also a great iPad stand.

## 👨‍💻 #iPadPro has all the apps I need to run a company!

I run @Nozbe and use it on the iPad, together with @WorkingCopyApp, @iAWriter, @Textastic, @LumaTouch, @SlackHQ, @1Password, etc. I even record @NoOfficeFM podcast on it!

## 🖥️ #iPadPro supports external monitors!

I'm using my old Thunderbolt Display as an external monitor on my iPad. Yes, the Stage Manager is still kinda meh, but it's OK for me!

## 📱 #iPadPro is a tablet which can be held with one hand 🖐️

When I'm not typing I can just un-snap it and hold in my hands and read stuff both horizontally and vertically, depending on the content.

## ⌨️ #iPadPro is a great typewriter!

Together with my new @Logitech #Ergo keyboard and a MagFlött stand I can put it in vertical mode and very ergonomically type longer texts!

## 🛜 #iPadPro has a 5G connection at all times!

Can your Mac do that? I'm online all the time. I don't even search for hotspots because my 5G connection is just fast enough for work and video calls!

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 #iPadPro is a family cellular router!

When we're traveling my family automatically can tether connection from my iPad, even when it's tucked in my backpack.

## ✏️ #iPadPro is a perfect visual feedback device!

When I give feedback to my team, I simply take a screenshot, write on it with #ApplePencil and attach this to a task in @Nozbe.

## 🧮 #iPadPro is a great homework digital notebook!

Thanks to the FreeForm app and the #ApplePencil I have infinite canvas to draw on so doing homework with my daughters is much more joyful!

## 🎬 #iPadPro is perfect for watching movies on the go!

All the streaming apps let you download content and the mini-LED display is awesome. You can connect two #AirPods at a time, so watching with wife works!

## 📸 #iPadPro easily connects to peripherals using USB-C

I'm flying my @DJIGlobal #MavicMini3Pro, take the SD card and pop it to a reader and edit my footage on the go in @LumaTouch

## 📽️ #iPadPro is can be a teleprompter!

As the CEO of @Nozbe I need to record many videos when I talk to the camera, I edit the texts on the iPad and then put the iPad below the teleprompter to say it all.

## 🔋 #iPadPro has an all-day battery life!

In this small form-factor I can work an entire day on the iPad. Yes, I'd love to have more, but with 7-8 hours of average use it's great!

## ✅ #iPadPro is the only computer I CAN use!
