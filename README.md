# Michael.team

Michael.team is a new blog of Michael Sliwinski. Now it's a work-in-progress. Some of the features:

- I need to first migrate ALL the blog posts from Sliwinski.com and build redirections
- I need to set up PL blog so that I have a place to post my thoughts in Polish... and migrate my old iMagazine articles.
- I need to set up ES blog so that I also have a place to talk in Spanish...
- Also DE will be in the works... but who knows!?

## Created in Jekyll with a nice structure.

Michael has fallen in love with Jekyll and now he's migrating all his stuff there. It started with [Nozbe.team](https://nozbe.team), later [NoOffice.org](https://NoOffice.org), [iPadOnly](https://ipadonly.com) and now his own blog.

- it's based on No Office blog
- it'll have texts of all his books in /books folder - we'll start with "It's All About Passion".
- it'll have languge stuff in /pl and /es folders.

## To-do

- do the initial commit and configure the domain and SSL
- make sure that works and then create /pl zone
- move search.js out of the main folder and create a list of files that can't be used (like about, now, etc.)
