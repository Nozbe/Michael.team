## Social media

This is the fastest way to get in touch with me:

* I'm very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSliwinski)
* I'm beginning to be more involved on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsliwinski)
* I sometimes post a story on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michaelsliwinski/)
* I'm no longer active on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.sliwinski) because I disagree with Mark Zuckerberg's stance on privacy and creepiness (yeah, I know Instagram is also owned by FB, so that's why I'm also not as active there as I used to beâ€¦)

## [Nozbe][n] questions?

If you have any questions regarding [Nozbe][n] the best way is to either [follow Nozbe on Twitter][tn] and tweet your question or [simply contact our 24/7 email support][support] for a quick answer.

> **Pro tip:** If you're a [Nozbe][n] customer and want to get in touch with me quickly, don't write to me directly but write to our customer support. They'll ping me internally and you'll have a better chance for a quick reply from me.

## Want to "pick my brain"?

Just read [my about page](/about) where I'm pointing you to all the things I'm passionate about.

If you want to learn productivity the fastest way possible:

* get my book: [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity](https://productivitycourse.com) (also available in [Polish](http://kursproduktywnosci.pl))
* or watch my [10-step video course in English](https://help.nozbe.com/bonus/introduction/), [Spanish](https://help.nozbe.com/es/bonus/introduction/), [Polish](https://help.nozbe.com/pl/bonus/introduction/), [German](https://help.nozbe.com/de/bonus/introduction/) and [Japanese](https://help.nozbe.com/ja/bonus/introduction/)
* or watch one of my [productivity Webinars](/webinar)

## Prefer to email me?

[Email me][email] if you want to:

* book me for a [speaking gig](/about/#speaking)
* do an [interview with me](/guest) - you'll find [my bio](/about/#short-bio) and [pictures](/about/#selfies) on my [about page](/about)
* ask me anything else - I will try to help if I can

I do read all the email but I sometimes can take time to respond and when I do, I'm "[emailing like texting](/emailing-like-texting)" - meaning I just reply to an email like a text - quick and to the point. That's how I roll.
