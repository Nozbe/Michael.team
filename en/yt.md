## Watch any YouTube video here, cookie free!

I created this web site because I was annoyed how YouTube/Google track me and I also wanted to be able to watch just one video without bindge-watching more. [Here's the full story behind this page][blog].

## Option 1. Just paste a YouTube URL link below

<form name="yt" onsubmit="showYouTube(true);">
<input name="link" type="text" value="" size="50" placeholder="Paste a URL like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmlB8y5Sig8" />
<button>Watch!</button>
</form>

## Option 2. If on iOS, get this Siri Shortcut

I created a handy Siri Shortcut which you can use to "share" any YouTube link to this page. [Get the Siri Shortcut][shortcut].

## Option 3. Just add a URL to this page as a parameter

This page has a special `yt` parameter, so add the YouTube link at the end of it:

`https://michael.team/yt?yt=`

## Enjoy!

I created this page mainly for me to be able to watch videos on my iPad and iPhone without being tracked by Google/YouTube. It uses the "nocookie" option of video embedding and it supports full screen on the iPadOS and iOS.
