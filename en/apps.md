### In this book I discuss the concept of "Pyramid of Communication" - which helps me and my team communicate effectively to get everything done. [See Table of Contents](#toc)

This book is based on my company’s concept of [pyramid of communication](https://sliwinski.com/communication-pyramid/), which I also discussed on the [18th episode of The Podcast](/podcast-18/). I later [revisited the concept here](https://sliwinski.com/pyramid/) and [on the 65th episode of The Podcast](/podcast-65/). Based on all this, as well as frequent questions from readers about [apps I use and recommend](https://sliwinski.com/ama-apps/) and [apps I use at my company](https://sliwinski.com/noofficeapps) I decided to write this book.

## "No Office Apps" - Table of Contents

Below is the table of contents with quotes from my book. This way you'll have a better "feel" of the book and its contents. You'll quickly see why a simple article on the pyramid of communication wasn't enough and I had to convert it to an entire book:

* TOC
{:toc}

### Introduction: Where are you based?

> "Q: Where are you based? A: We don’t have an office. We all work from home..."

> "Our mission is to help people get more done - we tweak anything we can to work better..."

### Traditional Office: I can just walk to you!

> "Talk is not cheap. Interrupting somebody costs time. Face-to-face talking is expensive..."

> "Email is so last century... so at @Nozbe we try to avoid it for internal communication..."

### Pyramid of Communication

> "There are actually 5 levels of communication: between highest and lowest bandwidth."

> "Pyramid of communication: spend time on Level 1, less on Level 2, much less on Level 3, 4 & 5."

### Level 1: Deep Work

> "Pyramid level 1: Communicate through work, it's all about focus and apps."

> "Pyramid of Communication level 1: At this level we communicate through our work."

> "Level 1 - work asynchronously and get your own work done in uninterrupted chunks of time..."

### Level 2: Feedback

> "Level 2 of team communication is all about getting feedback without interrupting others..."

> "Pyramid of Communication level 1: Ask for feedback in the most asynchronous way possible..."

> "Level 2 - get feedback, define responsibility, DON'T communicate with everyone!"

### Level 3: Back And Forth


> "Level 2 of team communication - let's chat about it using text..."

> "Pyramid of Communication level 3: It's all about quick feedback."

> "Level 3 is great for quick feedback as you're finishing off your project or task."

### Level 4: Talk To Me


> "Level 4 of team communication - it’s all about getting answers quickly with voice..."

> "Pyramid of Communication Level 4: It’s all about convenience."

> "Level 4 is to iron out the details, but be respectful and schedule your voice calls..."

### Level 5: Meetings


> "Level 5 of team communication - let’s meet face to face now..."

> "Pyramid of Communication Level 5: It's all about having a good reason for each meeting..."

> "Level 5 (#Meetings) is all about being prepared, getting feedback and NOT brainstorming..."

### Level 5+: Reunion


> "Reunions in an all-remote company: Twice a year, our entire team meets up for a week..."

> "At @Nozbe reunions it’s all about connecting with each other and spending quality time together..."

### Example: A Life of a Project at All Levels with Nozbe


> "Simple @nozbe use case: how the marketing team organizes a small event for some of the users..."

### A Different Example: Better code in Github


> "Github: You work on code, you commit it, you review other commits. You add comments. At your own pace."


### Examples of Meetings done right and wrong


> "Examples of #meetings: Spontaneous - when instant feedback and decisions are needed..."

> "Examples of #meetings: Design Fight - a regular meeting dedicated to Nozbe design, UI and UX"

> "Examples of #meetings: Stand up / Scrum meetings where our developers share every day..."

> "Examples of #meetings done wrong: a company-wide all-hands meeting..."

### Bonus: 5 Rules of effective communication


> "Bonus chapter: Effective communication on a dispersed team — 5 general rules"

### More Tips And Tricks: 7 Ways to improve interpersonal relations

> "Bonus chapter: communication in a dispersed team: 7 rules for improving interpersonal relations"

### Summary: Getting communication done


> "How to get team communication done? Clearly define your levels of communication!"
