## Your host - the founder and CEO of Nozbe

Hi, I'm [Michael Sliwinski](https://sliwinski.com/){:target='_blank'} and I'm the [founder and CEO](https://nozbe.com/michael){:target='_blank'} of [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/){:target='_blank'} - a to-do app for teams. We're a team of [25 people who work completely remotely from their 25 "home offices"](https://nozbe.com/about){:target='_blank'} and we've been doing this for the last 13+ years now. Nozbe and Nozbe Teams have more than 700K users from all over the world.

## I'm on a mission to help small teams do great things!

I'm all about "team productivity" and what it means for me is helping teams work better, in a calmer way, with flexible work hours, from anywhere (remote for life!) and with the modern tools of 2020.

## Short bio - a team productivity guy

Michael Sliwinski is a team productivity enthusiast who’s passionate about working remotely (#NoOffice) and in a mobile way (#iPadOnly). He's the founder of [Nozbe and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/){:target='_blank'}, apps that help people and teams get more done in a better way on any platform (web-based with native apps for the Mac, Windows, Android, iPad and the iPhone + Apple Watch).

## My additional projects:

* I'm currently writing a book on working better in a modern and more remote and flexible way: [#NoOffice](https://nooffice.org){:target='_blank'}.
* I'm [blogging](/tag/blogging) on [this site](/archive/) now and I used to do it on my [old site: sliwinski.com](https://sliwinski.com){:target='_blank'}.
* [I chat with Radek on "The Podcast . FM"](http://thepodcast.fm) - it's a semi-weekly podcast on "technology, productivity tips, business, publishing, and whatever else comes to mind..." - more than 200 episodes recorded to date!
* I do all that from my iPad - I'm ([#iPadOnly](https://iPadOnly.com){:target='_blank'}).

## Things I used to do:

* Between 2008-2017 I used to run the [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com/issues) where together with other productivity experts we shared our best tips and tricks. All the issues are available for free on the web in **[English](http://productivemag.com)**, [Polish](http://productivemag.pl), [Spanish](http://productivemag.es), [Dutch](http://productivemag.nl) and [Japanese](http://productivemag.jp)
* Before Nozbe (i.e. before 2007) as [apivision.com](http://apivision.com) I was a one-man web marketing department/consultant for [BuySculpture.com](https://buysculpture.com)
* Before that in the early 2000s I failed at launching several startups: [RSS publishing with HitRSS.com](http://hitrss.com), [Email auto-responders with Wyslij.info](http://wyslij.info) and banner-agency "ELLO". I also wrote a Windows launcher [called QTbar](http://qtbar.com) when I was in collage.

## My story (if you're really that interested!)

To learn more about my Nozbe story, [please read this interview with me](https://sliwinski.com/interview).

I was born in Gdynia, northern Poland (in Europe) and spent my childhood there. My mom started teaching me English when I was 6 and thus she fostered my interest in languages... and my father, who was an "electronics technician" got me interested in computers. [My parents are really amazing](https://sliwinski.com/parents). Together as a family (along with my younger brother [Przemek](http://smart-mod.pl)) we traveled every year somewhere for holidays... and that's why I still love traveling so much. Now, apart from Polish and English I also speak fluently two other European languages: Spanish and German... and I'm currently learning Japanese and French.

I have two university degrees. One from the University of Gdansk (Poland) in Business Economics and one from the Fachhochschule Stralsund (Germany) in Marketing. I also spent a year studying on the Technical University in Valencia (Spain) through the Erasmus exchange program.

Right after my graduation in 2003 I set up my own company "apivision.com" to pursue my interest in the Internet commerce. I founded several startups that eventually failed before I finally started something I was truly passionate about and managed to succeed with: Nozbe.

Initially I started Nozbe because I wanted to better manage my time and I was inspired by David Allen's book "Getting Things Done". Back in 2005 I couldn't find a tool that'd work for me so I built my own. I basically rewrote it twice before I launched it in 2007. Nozbe was my side project for an entire year before I decided to focus on running it full time in 2008. Now we're a 20+ fully-remote people in the Nozbe team. [Here's a short history of Nozbe written for our 10th anniversary](https://nozbe.com/blog/10-years/)

[I love what I do](https://sliwinski.com/5-loves/) so it doesn't feel like work. But apart from that I try to remain fit, especially as [I lost weight](https://sliwinski.com/fitness2014/) thanks to ["slow carb diet"](https://sliwinski.com/slow-carb-diet/) and started running [triathlons](https://sliwinski.com/triathlon) (I do 3-4 [olympic distance](https://sliwinski.com/triathlon-list/) a year: 1500m swim, 40km bike and 10km run). And recently [I picked up tennis](https://sliwinski.com/tennis).

I also [read about 30 books](https://sliwinski.com/reading) per year (actually [I’m listening to them](https://sliwinski.com/reading-audiobooks-and-absorbing-content)). I am a geek who likes technology gadgets (I'm an Apple fanboy) and cars. I am a [Christian](https://sliwinski.com/catholic) (Roman Catholic) and believe Jesus Christ to be my savior.

[I work from home](https://sliwinski.com/tag/office) and everyone on [my team works remotely](https://sliwinski.com/teleworking). I believe that *"job is not a place to go but a thing you do"*. I live in a very beautiful place in Europe with my wife Ewelina (who is a lawyer and you can see her on the photo above) and my three amazing daughters: Milena, Emilia and Liliana.

My name in Polish is: **Michał Śliwiński**.
