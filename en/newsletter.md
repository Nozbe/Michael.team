## What you'll receive every month

I promise I won't overwhelm your email inbox. I'll be sending an email to you once, maybe twice per month. It all depends on what I'd like to let you know about. My newsletter will be about two things:

### 1. A productivity tip

You'll receive one of my best productivity tips every month. Something actionable.

### 2. Updates on my writing

You'll also get a highlight reel of my best blog posts from the month before as well as the main topics of the podcasts I published: [NoOffice FM](/noofficefm) and [The Podcast](/podcast).

### 3. Progress on the [#NoOffice book](/nooffice)

I'll be reporting on the progress of my writing of the [NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) and I might ask you for your feedback.

That's it. And remember, [I respect your privacy](/privacy) and you can unsubscribe anytime. Thanks!
