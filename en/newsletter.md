As my newsletter subscriber every month you'll receive 3 things: an actionable productivity tip, an update on my writing with highlights from my [#NoOffice FM podcast](/noofficefm) and the progress report on the [NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) and… I might ask you for your feedback! Fill out the form below to join my *inner circle*! See you on the other side!

## What you'll receive every month

I promise I won't overwhelm your email inbox. I'll be sending an email to you once, maybe twice per month. It all depends on what I'd like to let you know about. My newsletter will be about two things:

### 1. A productivity tip

You'll receive one of my best productivity tips every month. Something actionable.

### 2. Updates on my writing

You'll also get a highlight reel of my best blog posts from the month before as well as the main topics of the podcasts I published: [NoOffice FM](/noofficefm) and [The Podcast](/podcast).

### 3. Progress on the [#NoOffice book](/nooffice)

I'll be reporting on the progress of my writing of the [NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) and I might ask you for your feedback.

That's it. And remember, [I respect your privacy](/privacy) and you can unsubscribe anytime. Thanks!
