# Simple and respectful privacy policy

I want this site to be as quick to load as possible and as respectful of your privacy as can be, so I've reduced everything to minimum.

## 1. No tracking by Google, Facebook or other big tech

The only tracker on this site is designed by us at [Nozbe][n] and we use it mainly to give me some basic stats on this site.

This small tracker works with [Nozbe Referral Program](https://nozbe.com/blog/referral-program-nozbe-how-to-earn/?c=michaelteam) so our partners can link to this site, too and when people go from this site to [Nozbe][n] and become a paying customer of [Nozbe Teams][n] or [Nozbe Personal][np], they get a commission.

## 2. Newsletter fully compliant with GDPR

My [Monthly Newsletter](/newsletter) is fully compliant with the latest GDPR rules so people can sign up easily and unsubscribe anytime with just one click.

I don't sell your email to anyone. I don't add you to [Nozbe][n] mailing list. When you join, you just join here.

That's it. No other cookies, trackers, or anything like this.
