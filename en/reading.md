# Books - my ultimate list of the (audio)books I've read in the past and I'm reading now

## Latest Update: October 20, 2017

> Note: I'm about to update this page. It's long outdated!

As a CEO of an established company [Nozbe][n] I need to keep growing as a leader and the best way to do that is to read lots of books. As they say: *"Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers"!* But how to find time for books? Well, back in 2010 [I started listening to audiobooks][a] instead of reading physical books and I went from 2 books per year to around 30... and from then on I've been either [listening to audiobooks][a] or [podcasts][p]. Right now my Audible library is really huge so I created a document with the list of all the books I read in the past. I was losing track. And I only managed to [write about some of them on this blog](/books/). Long story short, I decided to share my list of books with you - together with links, notes, everything right here... on this page. Here goes:

<a name="notes"></a>
## 2. Books I've read - no review yet, only loose notes:

*(I'll be gradually adding more notes to the section here)*

### Books I've read in 2017

* **A Guide to the Good Life** by William B. Irvine ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1522632735?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00G6ZLMDC?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy 1st Edition, Kindle Edition*

> Very good book! Eye opening how stoicism still can be applied to our life - and even to a person like me who is catholic! It was so good we both discussed it on the [The Podcast](/podcast) in two episodes! [First in episode #103](/podcast-103) and later [in episode #104](/podcast-104)

* **The Miracle Morning.** by Hal Elrod ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0979019710?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00CLCNROG?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life*

> Well, this book wasn’t as good as people were saying, maybe because I already get the power of a morning routine...

* **The Oxygen Advantage** by Patrick McKeown ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062349457?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01BLV3SRS?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Simple, Scientifically Proven Breathing Techniques to Help You Become Healthier, Slimmer, Faster, and Fitter*

> Was kinda skeptical about this book but it has some counterintuitive opinions of how we should breathe and the importance of not over-breathing - and a few breathing exercises I should be trying soon. Let’s see if what the author is really saying... really works.

* **Skunk Works** by Leo Janos, Ben R. Rich ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316743003?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B011LR4PW4?tag=sliwinski-20)) *A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed*

> Interesting stories of how 117A and other anti-radar planes were constructed, the importance of Cold War and the ways they had to deliver projects... where some of them were really top secret!

* **Ask** by Ryan Levesque ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1939447720?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B010CFJWRY?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Counterintuitive Online Method to Discover Exactly What Your Customers Want to Buy...Create a Mass of Raving Fans...and Take Any Business to the Next Level*

> Interesting method which we haven’t applied at [Nozbe][n] just yet but we’re thinking about it. Still haven’t made my mind about the value of it, but will definitely have to give it a try!

* **Competing Against Luck** by Clayton Christensen ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062435612?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01IIGPYGC?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice*

> Another take on Clay’s theory of "jobs to be done" and how we should be thinking about our products in this way - what jobs are they hired to do by which kind of customers? It’s a difficult question that doesn’t have a straightforward answer as jobs can vary not only on type of customer but also on the timing of them getting to know the product...

* **Bad Science** by Ben Goldacre ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B006WRE0IS?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479186?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks*
  
> Here I’ve learned why homeopathy is complete BS and why many quasi-scientific research results can sound scientific yet can be used just to fill out the goal of the manufacturer of the thing... scary stuff!
  
* **How We Learn** by Benedict Carey ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00M22DEDO?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812984293?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens*

> This book was flat out boring and I didn’t really take much value from it. I’m not sure if I actually finished it... it’s all about storing memories and repetiotions... but I feel like I’ve read better books on that subject before...

* **The Challenger Sale** by Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B0114WNG76?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1591844355?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Taking Control of the Customer Conversation*

> Very good salesman book - I really liked how the seller should be not only an advisor but also should be challenging the customer into thinking differently about their market and their business. This is what we’re trying do with Nozbe and we’ll try more of that in the future!

* **You Are Not So Smart** by David McRaney ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B006K4GN56?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592407366?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, an d 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself*

> Very uncomfortable book to read - turns out we’re victims of our biases much more than we think we are... I need to re-read this book again and take good notes. It was really eye-opening!
  
* **Nonviolent Communication** by Marshall Rosenberg ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00TKMBJKE?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/189200528X?tag=sliwinski-20)) *A Language of Life, Life-Changing Tools for Healthy Relationships*

> Very good book on feelings and expressing them... and asking the key question: "what needs of yours do you want to have met?", we discussed it on [The Podcast #110](/podcast-110)

* **Black Box Thinking** by Matthew Syed
  ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1591848229?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B0161R2O7W?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Why Most People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do*
  
> Amazing book about the blame game that people (and industries) are playing and how we should "own our shit" = own our mistakes and learn from them. If we don't admit to mistakes - we won't be able to move forward. Will review it soon on this blog + the podcast.
  
* **Fooled by Randomness** by Nassim Taleb
  ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V8H28C?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812975219?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets*
  
> Interesting book on the role of randomness in our lives.  We talked about it on [The Podcast - episode 92](/podcast-92).

* **Will It Fly?** by Pay Flynn ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0997082305?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01CT90UQI?tag=sliwinski-20))

> A blueprint of how to check if your idea "will fly" and make sense in the real world. Maybe I'm not the target audience of this one but I didn't like this book so much. If you're totally new to the building-your-business-online thing then maybe it's for you. It wasn't for me.

* **Better Than Before** by [Gretchen Rubin](https://sliwinski.com/gretchen-rubin-in-the-upcoming-productive-magazine-11) ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00R8KR28I?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385348630?tag=sliwinski-20)) *What I learned about making and breaking habits - to sleep more, quit sugar, procrastinate less, and generally build a happier life*

> Very good follow up to her previous book - The Happiness Project ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B0030MV7MU?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062414852?tag=sliwinski-20)) - and a good book to read after the Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg - because this book is about habits and understanding how they can help us be better and happier. I really liked it!

* [**Sleep Smarter**](https://sliwinski.com/sleep) by Shawn Stevenson ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1623367395?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01J4BK4MY?tag=sliwinski-20)) *21 Essential Strategies to Sleep Your Way to a Better Body, Better Health, and Bigger Success*

> Great book on the importance of sleeping well. [Reviewed it on this blog](https://sliwinski.com/sleep) and on [The Podcast - episode 87](/podcast-87).

* [**The Life-Changing Magic of Tyding Up**](https://sliwinski.com/kondo) by Marie Kondo ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01M03NLJY?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1607747308?tag=sliwinski-20)) *A simple, effective way to banish clutter forever*
  
> Amazing book on tidying and cleaning and clutter-free places. This book completely changed the way I approach storing things. I'be already re-designed my home office and my wardrobe according to this method and it feels great! [Read my review](https://sliwinski.com/kondo)

* **The Coaching Habit** by [Michael Bungay Stanier](https://sliwinski.com/show-58-michael-bungay-stanier/) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0978440749?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01HH7IORO?tag=sliwinski-20)) *Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever*

> Interesting book on coaching and how we should be asking our peers questions to learn from them and teach them at the same time. I'll probably elaborate on this more later. 

* **Talking as Fast as I Can** by Lauren Graham
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01L0H7I24?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0425285170?tag=sliwinski-20)
  
> If you're a "Gilmore Girls" fan like me and my wife, you're really going to like this book. Lots of great stories from Lauren as well as some "behind the scenes" info on how the show Gilmore Girls got done. And a productivity trick for aspiring authors as a bonus.
  
* **Scrappy Little Nobody** by Anna Kendrick
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01ETUKSM6?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501117203?tag=sliwinski-20)

> If you're Anna Kendrick fan like I am (after seeing her in "Up in the Air" and "Pitch Perfect") it's her story - how she got into acting, Broadway and later Hollywood. What she's trying to say here is that she's just a girl who's trying to figure it all out. Like every other girl. Not a know-it-all celebrity. Entertainment.

  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553418025?tag=sliwinski-20)

  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316306088?tag=sliwinski-20)
  *My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble*

  *One Entrepreneur's Take on Leadership, Social Media, and Self-Awareness*

* **The Thrid Wave** by Steve Case
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01CIRT3V4?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/150113258X?tag=sliwinski-20)
  *An Entrepreneur’s Vision of the Future*

* MONEY Master The Game by Tony Robbins
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00OPB09R4?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476757860?tag=sliwinski-20)

> **Update:** They finally released an abridged version of this book (7 hours - get it and let me know in the comments if it's worth listening). Notes: I couldn't get around to finishing this one. Long audio book (21 hours) and I dropped half way through it. Basically: your financial brokers are cheating on you with management costs (duh!) and you should focus on the power of compounding (the more you save, the more you invest, the longer you do it... the better the results). And I don't know... too much talking too little practical take aways from me.

* Trust Me, I'm Lying by Ryan Holiday
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B008MMRKNI?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1591846285?tag=sliwinski-20)

> Great book about how content creators con people and press to get coverage. How to create news out of thin air, how to manipulate press and others. Really morally questionable but it's good to be aware of this and know this stuff is happening. And it's spooky to know what extra lengths people will go to get press...

* Minecraft by Linus Larsson and Daniel Goldberg
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00IMJELRY?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IMW2UV0?tag=sliwinski-20)

> Interesting story of the founder of Minecraft. I'm a sucker for biographies of successful people and you can't say that Minecraft wasn't successful. The sale to Microsoft was just icing on the cake. But to be able to create such a following and fan base and such an epic game was an amazing feat. And the guy was your typical geek who just had a great idea and (of course) great execution.

* Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00CH3UI28?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/039334777X?tag=sliwinski-20)

> I hated statistics at the University. I wish I had a book like this to teach me stats. What seems like a boring subject was shown in a great way, with lots of examples and practical ways of using data. And how to use data to manipulate outcomes or bend them towards your goals. Now I understand more when I listen to stats on the news... it's amazing how the same sample of data can prove two contrary theories, depending on how you show it and which measures you focus on...

* $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau
  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B008165WSK?tag=sliwinski-20)

> kick-in-the-pants book to move it up, basic advice - lots of success stories, less detail - $100 is a headline catcher - it takes more than that - Nozbe as like a $100 startup kind of - focuses on being on your own and at least matching your salary doing what you love - I say doing what you love is the most important thing - You can live anywhere and do a global business - I do live by that

* Tribes by [Seth Godin][sg]

It's all about passion and communication - Kick in the pants to inspire you to lead- I know this, I'm trying to find a leader in myself - shaping the future of the "productivity industry" - Short manifesto - but I like Seth's manifestos, they inspire and pump me up

> Good ol selling advice - Very good tips and tricks - how to sell - Good ethical advice - How you have to believe in what you're selling - The "why" is there, too. - Although we don't sell door to door anymore - selling is the most important thing - I want to become a bestselling author - not a best writing one

  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B0036GRNPA?tag=sliwinski-20)
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401309666?tag=sliwinski-20)

> Untapped markets everywhere - Easy customization - Democratization of goods - See how you can reach these markets - Mass culture is series of niches - Less cost to distribute - more cost in "intelligence" to help people find something JUST FOR THEM - Recommendations, rankings to help people search niches - Niches when added up - do more than the hits

  [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B005LXV0HI?tag=sliwinski-20)
