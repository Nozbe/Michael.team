### In my book I'm sharing the story of 7 types of passion I discovered over 7 years of running my productivity startup. [See Table of Contents](#toc)

> "Thanks to Michael, I have learned that it doesn't matter what your passion is, it matters how far you are willing to go with it, how much you are going to learn from it, and most importantly who you are going to share it with. With this book you got to experience Michael’s passion the same way I did." - [Augusto Pinaud](http://twitter.com/apinaud)
