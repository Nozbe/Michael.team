# Why do we need the Productive! Magazine? Let's rediscover the obvious.


It hasn't been a week yet since we've launched the first issue of the [Productive! Magazine](/magazine) and the results have surprised me so much that I actually don't know how to express my excitement! Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I'll be happy to thank everyone who participated in this project and downloaded the magazine.

## I've received lots of great feedback and high praise on this first issue! Thanks!

Most of it was very, very positive. You - the readers have made me blush on numerous occasions and you've made me really happy this passing week. There was also some constructive critisism, especially regarding editing (some typos and grammar mistakes... and we've corrected a few already) - we'll do better with the next issue (got some volunteer-proofreaders, the more eyeballs, the less mistakes!). I was trying to track most of the blogs that wrote about the magazine and read the comments of the readers over there and several times some people (trolls?) wrote very harshly that our magazine is yet another "productivity p0rn" and that we should be productive and not read about productivity...

## So why do we need the Productive! Magazine? (and the whole productivity blogroll?)

### Because we need to rediscover the obvious every now and then.

We do. I've read the book by David Allen (see inteview in the magazine), "Getting Things Done" like 4 times already... and every time I'm learning something new, something I haven't noticed before (or haven't paid enough attention to). The same applies to reading blogs by the productivity bloggers included in the Productive! Magazine. These are real-life examples of real-life people who are struggling to be better and more productive just like we are... and if we can relate to even a smallest part of their life... we can relate to our life and our problems and try to improve ourselves. And very often we do need to rediscover the obvious.... and to learn again something we thought we knew, but lost it or forgot somewhere down our road.


When compiling the magazine and reading the submitted articles, I've had several "a-ha" moments and learned many "new" things that I actually knew about in the past! This is the power of rediscovering the obvious aspects of life that can help you in your path of personal development.

I remember the argument when I told a friend of mine that I developed [Nozbe][n] to help myself and others get things done, and he laughed in my face saying: "why do we need another to-do application?"... and I smiled and responded: "a to-do application (or pen and paper for that matter) doesn't work for me. I tried. I need something more structured, I need to easily access my next actions and contexts... and my to-do list would be just too long without them... and totally useless".

Every one of us is different. Our lives are different. Our goals are not the same... and our ways of getting things done can be totally diverse... and because of that the mission of the Productive! Magazine is to try to find the best productivity-related articles that approach our lives from different angles and that everyone can find something for themselves. And learn something new. **And rediscover the obvious.**
