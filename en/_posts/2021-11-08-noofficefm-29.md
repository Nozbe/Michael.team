# No Office FM #29: Working across time zones

Welcome to the episode #29 of my podcast about working remotely with Rafal, [Nozbe][n]'s VP of Product. Last week I was on holidays so Rafal invited Emilia from our team to talk about how she works with us when sheâ€™s in Taiwan and the rest of our team is in Europe and how itâ€™s possible to co-work with a partner in the same place. Interesting!
