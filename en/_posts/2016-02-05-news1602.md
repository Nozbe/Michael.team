# Have you set up your New Year's goals yet? It's still not too late!

*Note: This post is a transcript of my "Passionate Productivity" newsletter which I send to people who read my book "It's all about Passion!" - if you want to be receiving weekly emails from me in the future, [get the book by signing up](/newsletter/) - thank you!*

Time flies! We're already in February of this New Year of 2016 and I've just celebrated [9 years of running Nozbe][s4]. And when people ask me what's next for me, I tell them: [I'm just getting started.][s5]

**How was 2015 for you?**

[This is how it went for me][s1] - in a nutshell, pretty stable but with some things that definitely need improvement.

One of the things I decided to focus on is the "[No Office][s2]" theme on my blog. After all, in my company [there is no office - we all work remotely][s3] and I believe many people and companies can learn from us and everything we've tested running an all-remote team.

For this reason I started a publication on [Medium, called "No Office"][m]. Let me know what you think!

**What are your goals for 2016?**

* [Here's how I think this year should play out][s6]
* [Here's how I plan my goals using Nozbe][n2]
* [Here's how my mentor Michael Hyatt does it][n1]

Hope you'll find advice there on planning your goals for this year. We have still 11 months left in 2016 so it's still not too late to get your goals in order and start achieving them!

**More advice for you in my podcast:**

If you prefer listening to reading, I do recommend you check out [the latest episodes of "The Podcast"][s7] where we talked about our goals for this year, diets, fitness habits and shared some behind-the-scenes info about our [Nozbe 3.0 launch][n3]
