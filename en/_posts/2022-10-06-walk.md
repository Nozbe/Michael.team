# Meeting by walking around is the healthiest way to do meetings!

There’s a management technique “old-school office managers” use which is called “management by walking around”. As a “[#NoOffice company](/nooffice)” I cannot do that, but what I can do and what I recommend you to start doing is this: “**meeting by walking around**”. Basically, when you’re having a meeting, go out for a walk and have it while walking around:

## Schedule a meeting, go out, start an audio call and… walk and talk!

Recently I’ve had a few meetings with my CTO and [The Podcast co-host](/podcast/) Radek and each time we were scheduled to talk, we’d both go outside and have a walk. We live 2,000km apart, so we cannot meet outside, but by the power of FaceTime Audio we can have a great conversation while walking around town.

This tradition actually started when we were locked down in the [pandemic](/covid/) and they would only let you go outside when you were walking on your own. So it was a perfect excuse to go outside and walk alone while chatting with each other.

## All you need is your [phone](/iphone), [wireless headphones](/airpods) and a bottle of water!

Speaking of [AirPods Pro](/airpods), I use them for these meetings as they cancel out noises and have a decent microphone. I always take the bottle of water (750ml) so that I stay hydrated. I start an “outdoor walk workout” on my [Apple Watch](/applewatch) and we talk.

While we chat, when I need to refer to something, I can always stop and open [Nozbe][n] on my iPhone to discuss a particular task or comment. And then continue walking!

## Get out of the office! Start a meeting by walking around!

While I was meet-walking the other day, my friends were passing by in their car close to me, they stopped and asked where I was going. I responded that I was on a meeting. My friend was surprised and she shouted:

> Michael, I love your job!

That was so sweet. But please do try it yourself. Maybe you will also be able to have a meeting like that! I totally recommend it! Walking and talking is good for your heart, your overall health and keeps you calmer if you walk around nature (go to a park!). Will you try it?
