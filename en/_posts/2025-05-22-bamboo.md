# LEGO Lucky Bamboo

This week I [celebrated my birthday](/forty6) and I got a "plant" from my wife. She had a brilliant idea that I should get something green to my home office that won't need much maintenance and will also wake up the child in me. So I got a [Lucky Bamboo](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lucky-bamboo-10344) set ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/43rdx9D)).

## I love LEGO plants!

I already have the [Bonsai Tree](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bonsai-tree-10281) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3YZH0pQ)) and now I will have a new one. I started building in the evening with my parents who visited me to celebrate my birthday:

What's interesting is that finally LEGO company is not putting the bricks in plastic bags but in paper ones. OK, these are not transparent but they are much more convenient to use and you're not feeling like you're polluting the earth.

## Lucky Bamboo in my [home office](/office)

I've created a dedicated place in my [home office](/office25) for this plant. A special stand if you will. Now all my Lego pieces look great together:

Now that I've posted about my [birthday gift](/birthday) I see that I've never posted how I built my Chinese Dragon Year calendar and Bonsai tree. Maybe some time in the future?
