# On July 7 '23 I am…

…starting my “summer months” which means, no meetings, lots of vacation time, lots of deep work sessions and thinking - recharging battery for what’s going to be a very busy end of the year for [Nozbe][n].

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We just completed the [Nozbe pricing changes](/nozbe-pricing-changes) - and it was very successful - a great relief for me personally - I love ❤️ my [Nozbe][n] customers!
* We’re getting ready to launch new **Nozbe Business Plans** in September which will enable customers manage several teams easily within Nozbe. Exciting times!
* After more than a year of uncertainty, things are looking up for our app, our team and the future of [my business](/business). I’m excited!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m gonna take the summer to review my [#NoOffice book project](https://NoOffice.org/)
* I’m going to keep posing on [LinkedIn](https://michael.gratis/in) and try other social media platforms over the summer, too!

## …and privately:

* We have lots of family plans for the summer - a camper (RV - yet again!), a week just one-on-one with my wife without kids and many other small trips. Family time!
* We’re sending all three of our daughters to a summer camp for the first time without us. Let’s see how they like it!
