# Another Porsche LEGO set - building the 911 RSR

After my success with [Porsche GT3 RS](/gt3) I decided to add another, a little smaller and less complicated, yet still cool Porsche lego set - the [Porsche 911 RSR](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/porsche-911-rsr-42096) which I got myself for Christmas [2020](/2020) - to basically cheer myself up in the middle of the [Covid](/covid) pandemic. Here's how the build process went down:

## Step 1 - suspension and wheels ðŸ›ž 

We start at the very bottom of the car:

Until we build the Porsche sport suspension for all four wheels:

**Side note:** I like to put the lego pieces in the old boxes of my [iPads](/ipadonly) or [iPhones](/iphone). This way I can easily find the pieces I need for each stage of build.

## Step 2 - famous Porsche 6-cylinder boxer engine

Now it's time to put the engine in the car. It's [2017 Porsche 911 RSR, 991 generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_RSR#Porsche_991_RSR) which:

> It was still a naturally aspirated engine based on the engine generation of the 911 GT3 R and 911 GT3 Cup with direct injection. Depending on the size of the restrictor, the 4.0-liter boxer six-cylinder developed around 375 kW (510 hp)

After the engine, it was time for steering wheel and continued drive train build:

## Step 3 - time for some famous Porsche shape

Bodywork of the car is beginning to take shape:

And here was its place in my [2021 office](/office21).

## What I'm getting this Christmas?

This Christmas, as per tradition, I'm getting a new LEGO set, this time it's [R2 D2 Star Wars](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/r2-d2-75308) - I always wanted to have this robot in my [home office](/office) and I can't wait to build it!
