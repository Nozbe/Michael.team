# Getting vaccination done for COVID-19

Finally both me and my wife managed to get our first shot ðŸ’‰ of the [Moderna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_COVID-19_vaccine) type of [the vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine) against the [COVID-19](/covid) disease. In this short blog post I want to explain why we got it, why I'm excited about it and why I hope to encourage you to give it a shot (pun intended) as well. Here's us after we got ours:

## mRNA vaccines and the Mother effing Nature at its best!

When I saw the below video, I was blown away how the new mRNA vaccines work. They basically inject one (out of 29) types of protein from the COVID-19 into our body, which in turn is prompted to create antibodies for it and remember that this thing is bad.

That's amazing. How we can stimulate Mother Nature to do its best work. How our body can create antibodies on demand based on the information we give to it:

After watching this video I wanted to get one of [these mRNA based vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine). Other vaccines are good, too. Any vaccine is great.

## Do your research and get vaccinated!

What in this day and age completely flabbergasted me is the response of many intelligent people, about why they choose not to get vaccinated.

I mean, why? What's the deal?

We live in 2021. The access to information is infinite. I believe any smart person can do their own research to see if vaccines are good, if these vaccines were properly researched, if the mRNA technology is valid enough. I don't have to convince you and I won't. Do your research. Don't depend on alarmist information you see on social media but just spend 15 minutes researching the subject.

If you don't believe me, take John Oliver's word for it, he can explain things like no other:

## Pro tips on getting the vaccine

If you can, get an appointment. In Poland we have a very good online system where you can log in with your trusted profile and just choose a place, date, time and vaccine - and get an appointment.

Once it's scheduled, 2 hours before the appointment get 650 mg or 1g of paracetamol so that you don't feel the effect of the vaccine too much.

We did it and it worked. We felt fine after. Just the arm muscle was pretty sore for a couple of days. Nothing else.

Good luck. Do your research. Be smart. Choose health. Let's get this pandemic over together.

And if you're catholic like me, [listen to pope Francis](https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1391056548152152064).
