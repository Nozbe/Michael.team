# The apps and services we use at our remotely-working company

At [Nozbe][] we all work [remotely](/teleworking) and to communicate and work effectively we use a few apps and services that help us get things done. The other day someone asked me about it on Twitter and I [tweeted back][T] but in this short post I'd like to elaborate a little more on our choice of apps:

<!--More-->

![{{ page.title }}](/img/{{ page.img }})

[Nozbe][] - we "eat our dog food" so we use our very own app not only to manage tasks and projects but also to communicate effectively through tasks. *We don't send emails to each other.*

[Slack][s] - as a company chat. And as a personal chat between people.

[Skype][y] - as a video and audio chat software. Although not as good as it used to be. 

[Dropbox][] - we share files through this service. This very blogging platform is based on it, too. 

Two services I didn't mention in my tweet:

[Evernote][] - we create notes in Evernote and attach them to tasks in Nozbe thanks to our great integration. 

[Github][g] - we write and collaborate on code through Github. Really good.

Two bonus apps:

[iMessage][m] - with folks who have Apple devices I prefer to chat through this. Works great with my [Apple Watch](/AppleWatch)

[1Password][o] - to share passwords between people (syncs through Dropbox)

***Question:*** *What's missing on this list? What do you use?*

P.S. No email here. My [assistant checks mine](/assistant). Why? Because [my team has my highest priority](/site), and with them I'm in touch through Nozbe.
