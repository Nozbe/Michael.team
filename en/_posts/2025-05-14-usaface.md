# Apple Watch face for my USA trip

Recently I was traveling in the USA and to make sure I knew what time there was in my time zone back in Europe and in the states I was visiting California, Arizona and… Utah. I created a new watch face combining the [World Clock](/worldclock/) and [Summer Face](/summerface/) which resulted in my "USA Watch face":

## Time zones are complicated…

I normally live in Europe with "Central European Time" which is 9 hours before the PST or "Pacific Standard Time". The problem is that I was also traveling through Utah as I was visiting the **Bryce Canyon** which is in MST or "Mountain Standard Time". Luckily on the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra/) we have the **"Modular Ultra"** watch face which you can customize like this:

## Top row of my "USA" watch face

- **Current temperature** (in Celsius, I'm not using Fahrenheit)
- **Remote for photos** (so I can easily take pictures with my iPhone and be on these picutres)
- **Activity rings** (for [sports](/sports) and easy access to step count)

## Clock and day/night

Later I have the current time in the place I'm at. Then I have the "world clock" complication that shows the time back at home in Europe (WAR stands for Warsaw, capital of Poland) and visually I can see if they're sleeping there or not.

## Bottom row with LA time and sunset

- **Current date**
- **Time in Los Angeles** (I'm flying back from LA)
- **Sunset/Sunrise** (to know how much light we still have)

The last two complications were particularly important as I was sometimes on the border of Arizona and Utah and wanted to really know what time it was. Also as I was hiking in Bryce Canyon (pictured above) I wanted to make sure I could finish my hike before the sunset.

## Custom Watch faces, Apple? Pretty please!

As WWDC (Apple's Developers Conference) is approaching I'm still hoping that finally we get **custom watch faces** for the Apple Watch… but knowing how Apple wants to control it, I'm not holding my breath… and just keep customizing the only good watch face: Modular Ultra.
