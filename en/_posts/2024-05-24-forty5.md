# 45 and yet another iteration of Michael

This past Monday I turned 4Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ so it's time for [yet another birthday](/birthday) üéÇ post with one more year of reflections. As I'm half way through my forties I can clearly see it's gonna be all about iterations going forward. I'm iterating on myself, my life, my family, my [business](/business) and I like seeing things slowly but surely improve:

## To me iteration means learning and doing things slightly better‚Ä¶

According to [Collins dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/iteration):

> Iteration is repetition, or an act of repeating.

But also‚Ä¶

> An iteration of something is a version of it in which some details are different from earlier versions.

So yes, I'm repeating another year of still being a father of 3 daughters, a husband, a [triathlete](/sports), a [business](/business) owner of [Nozbe](/nozbe) but I'm focused on learning from the previous iteration and improving the new one. Looking back, analyzing, making slight changes and tweaking to making things better, more efficient and convenient.

## Better but only for me and people I care about‚Ä¶

As I'm in my mid forties I think I finally know what's really important in life. Also I truly appreciate much more that I'm in a position that lets me care only about these important things. Nothing more. Myself, my family, my friends, my team, my [Nozbe][n] customers‚Ä¶ and only these acquaintances that are kind to me‚Ä¶ and that's pretty much it.

I don't need nor want to impress more people. I mean it's always nice to have more [Nozbe][n] customers or more followers to my new [YouTube channel](/channel), but not at all costs. The growth for the sake of growth doesn't motivate me and most of all, I'm in a position that I don't need that.

And I'm grateful for this. [For not needing to give too many fucks](/podcast-201).

## Better as a consequence of trying and learning‚Ä¶

As I set up my [YouTube Channel][y] and started posting "Shorts" I had to learn new tools like *CapCut* and the whole idea of what it means to post a short video and cross-post it on [Instagram][i], [LinkedIn][l] or [TikTok][t]. With each video I keep getting better. I even figured out how to make [Two Michaels](/michaels/) work [in a long video](/meetings/).

Same goes with [Shortcuts](/shortcuts). I have developed quite a few of them and keep using them every day on all of my devices: [iPhone](/iphone), [iPad](/ipadonly) and [Watch](/applewatch). As I learn to journal, I keep improving my [Journaling Shortcut](/journal/), as I use [Action button](/action) and [Clipboard Manager](/clipboard) I have new ideas how to make them more powerful than ever.

As I get new customers for [Nozbe][n] I study how they sign up, where they learn about us and how we can optimize their way into the app better. We just got rid of [free trials](/trial), we cautiously [raised prices](/pricing-new) and we've finally figured out our [core values](/nozbe-values). And as our industry keeps getting more competitive with similar apps with infinite marketing budgets and AI on the horizon, I keep iterating and learning of where to go next, always keeping the interest of my customers and team in mind.

## Better despite the age‚Ä¶

As I'm in my mid-forties, I keep taking care of my health, keep doing [sports](/sports), keep [traveling](/travel) and keep taking care of my family. As I get older, I still feel there's so much more to do and to enjoy, and I'm planning to make the most of it.

On the picture above I'm trying out a high-altitude training, running at 2200 meters above sea level near the peak of [Teide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide) on the island of Tenerife. This was a tough run, but it was a perfect gift for myself on the morning of my birthday.

Here's to another 45 years as I plan to live at least till 90 or beyond! üí™

Thank you, my reader, for being part of my life. I truly appreciate you üôè
