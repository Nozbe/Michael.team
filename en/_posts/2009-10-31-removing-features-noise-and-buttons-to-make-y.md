# Removing features, noise and buttons to make your product perfect - like Apple Mighty Mouse

Today I visited our local Apple store to finally "feel and touch" the new Mighty mouse - world's first multi-touch mouse. Man, it's a beauty and pleasure to play with:

This tiny mouse looks like one of the most powerful mice in the world and yet...

## ... it has no buttons and no scrolling wheels!

So it basically lacks everything you'd expect from a mouse. And yet it's so powerful! And this doesn't mean you have to learn to use this mouse. Not really. Just move it around, click, scroll, right-click... Same old same old.

## Plus it has new gestures even!

This the typical Apple genious - remove noise, remove unnecessary buttons but improve the user interface and the way stuff works "behind the scenes".In the world where all mice manufacturers where adding buttons, scroll wheels, etc. - Apple removed them altogether.

As a startup owner/founder my goal with Nozbe 2.0 was to do the same thing: remove noise, remove buttons, sliders, dropdowns...And yet when I look at it I see there is still a lot that can be done... So I decided to do "weekly reviews" of Nozbe in a search for something to remove.

## Compare that to what this might could have been if Apple decided to just keep adding features:

## That's right. I'll be removing stuff from Nozbe. Literally.

Follow Apple's advice:**Keep removing noise while adding new features. Make stuff work "behind the scenes" and not "in your face".**

## Question: Which product has made your life simpler lately? If you're a Nozbe user, which stuff you don't want to see on your screen?
