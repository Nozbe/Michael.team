# A complete list of iPad apps that let me be #iPadOnly

This post will be really geeky, but you'll love it - an updated list of my [productivity](/productivity) iPad Apps! Here's the backstory: a few years back I co-wrote a book [iPadOnly - How to use only your iPad to work, play and everything in between][o] where I recommended a set of apps that help me get everything done on the iPad. In the meantime I got my [iPad Pro](https://sliwinski.com/babyipad/) and I kept updating this blog with my impressions of [iPad Pros and iPadOnly work](/ipadonly) and I've also posted a [list of apps I use on my iPhone](https://sliwinski.com/ama-apps/) but as lots of people keep asking me about this, here's a list of the iPad apps I use now to get things done and make it my main productivity workhorse.

## Bonus: experiment with app layout

Before we move on to the list of apps, as you can see on the screenshot of my iPad above, I've decided to experiment a little with my app layout recently. I just hated it that I had apps on different screens and was very often tempted to get distracted when I wanted to write something but opened the Twitter app as it was just "on the way" to my writing app... so I started using folders as my "focused environments" and group my apps together. These groups give me a few benefits, like:

* groups are focused on "jobs to be done" so I can concentrate on what I need to do, like writing, reading, etc.
* groups create order so I don't install too many apps on my iPad and don't bloat it
* groups fit on one screen, so at a glance I basically see all the apps I've got
* groups leave some empty space so I can use a nice inspiring background - a photo of San Sebasti√°n I took when I was on vacation with my family :-)

OK, here's the list of all of my apps from these groups:

## Apps without a folder

*Apps I need to be able to access quickly at any time*

* Clock - I just like how it tells time directly on the iPad's home screen + I use world clock a lot as I have virtual meetings with people from all over the world from different time zones
* Calendar - I still use the default calendar app. It's fine for me. I use iCal and Google Calendar there (which we share in our team)
* [Nozbe][n] - I mange my tasks, projects, team and company all in Nozbe (duh!) thanks to private and shared projects. In my company we use Nozbe to build Nozbe.

## Settings

*Apps that help me set things up on my iPad*

![Settings {{ page.title }}](/img/ipadapps-2.jpg)

* Settings app
* [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager-and-secure-wallet/id568903335?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vvCJ&ct=sliwinski) - is where I store passwords. I use a few vaults - one is my personal and a few are with team
* [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation-made-simple/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vvCJ&ct=sliwinski) - I love this, I have a few workflows done. Like [journaling](https://sliwinski.com/journal) and adding notes to my [book notes](https://sliwinski.com/reading/)
* App Store

## Which apps do you use? What am I missing?

Over the years I've been testing and using many different apps and once I stopped using something I simply removed it. That's why this is now a complete list of the apps I use and recommend. This is how I get things done on my iPad. These apps let me be ["iPad Only"](/ipadonly) and work from anywhere using my iPad Pro.

***Question:*** *Your recommendations?*
