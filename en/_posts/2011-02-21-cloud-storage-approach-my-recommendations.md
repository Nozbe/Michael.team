# Cloud storage approach... my recommendations?

One of my Nozbe users asked me the other day this question:

> _I am a huge Nozbe fan, glad to be using it again and I really appreciate what you've done to make it an awesome tool. _
> 
> _Question: what approach (if any) have you taken to create a cloud-based storage approach for your documents and reference materials, where you have access no matter where you are? I am currently testing a blend of Evernote, Dropbox, Windows Live/SkyDrive and a couple of others in a hodgepodge that is not working the way it needs to ... seamless. _
> 
> _**SO, any recommendations? **_

Here's what I responded to him:

> _Hello Steve and thanks for your kind message! _
> 
> _I actually use a blend of Evernote and Dropbox - I use Evernote for all notes (and try to produce as few "documents" as possible and use notes in Evernote instead) as they sync with Nozbe.. and I use Dropbox for the rest of my files and as Dropbox will sync with Nozbe in a few weeks, this will make it even better :-) _
> 
> _Once I'm done with a document in Dropbox and I no longer need it, I upload it to Nozbe to the appropriate project, so I don't keep the documents on my computer locally when I'm not actively working on them. (but I have them in Nozbe, so they never get lost) _
> 
> _Hope it helps, _
> 
> _- Michael_

To sum up - this is my basic flow:

  * I try to produce as few files as possible, I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com) and produce mainly notes
  * When I do use files, I put them in [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) and keep them there
  * When I'm done with these files (projects completed) I either move them to a "completed" directory in Dropbox or upload them to [Nozbe][n] to appropriate project

That's it. [Evernote syncs with Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/evernote) and Dropbox will sync with Nozbe soon, too. So it's a great approach which not only gives me a cloud-based storage but also project-relevant access to my files and notes.

_How do you handle cloud storage?_
