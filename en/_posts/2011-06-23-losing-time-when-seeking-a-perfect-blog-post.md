# Losing time when seeking a perfect blog post


If you look at my blog you'll see it's been more than three weeks since I posted anything. It's not that I don't have anything to say (I have material for more than one blog post a day), I just have so much on my plate that I forgot why I started this blog in the first place... and this blog post serves as a reminder why I (or anyone in my place) need to get back to posting on a regular basis.

## It all comes down to habits

I've stopped cultivating some of my habits and one of these was to post frequently. And if you're using services like posterous it's just one email more a day. I've learned how to process email to zero, but I've neglected emailing my blog. It's time to revisit this habit and also check out if there are other habits I neglected in the process.

## There is no perfect blog post

I read [Seth Godin's blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) every day and he keeps on reminding me to ship - write and ship - and some of his blog posts are not perfect, but most are really good and make me think. I have stuff like this to share in my head all the time... but I always seek to convert them into a more complete (aka perfect) blog posts that eventually... never get posted.

## I started blogging to learn to write and share... and learn from you!

Blogging is about writing and sharing - and I want to keep on learning how to scribble short and to the point blog posts so that I can get you (my reader) involved in the discussion - as I really want to hear your opinion and learn from you. We can learn from each other... and if I don't post, I just lose this opportunity.

## How about your blog or site? Time to re-activate it today!

If you are in a situation like me, time to take action. Stop seeking a perfect blog post and start writing. Most of the time your initial thoughts are really good - so cease the moment and write them up... and post them!

_Have you ever been in a situation like this? Any additional tips how to overcome this procrastination problem and to get back on the old habit?_

Do let me know :-) Let's hope to shake this up a little bit and start posting more!
