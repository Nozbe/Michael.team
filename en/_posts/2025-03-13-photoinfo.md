# Photo Info - quickly manipulate photos on iOS and Mac

On my [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly/) journey I keep making lots of [Shortcuts](/shortcuts) to improve my work on the [iPad](/ipadm4). Sometimes I need to manipulate images or photos. Here's a handy Shortcut for it:

## Photo Infoâ€¦ and manipulations!

### ðŸ”— [Photo Info][l]

I created this Shortcut many iOS releases ago, where getting to the info of an image was really hard. Now it's there if you press and hold a file or photo. However recently I've enhanced this Shortcut so that it would give me additional actions to choose from:

1. Resize
2. Duplicate
3. Crop to 16:9
4. Crop to square

This works for both images stored in your Photos library or in the Files. The cool thing is that to manipulate photos like this you don't have to open any other application. It's all done by the iOS.

## P.S. Bonus - you can add more options and enhance this Shortcut.

I've actually added a fifth option to this Shortcut and I'm launching my own [Tinify](/tinify) Shortcut so that I can right there shrink the file using this service.

Just make sure to add "Input" as "Shortcut Input" when you launch an external Shortcut. [Here's my modified Shortcut][l2].
