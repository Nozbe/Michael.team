# GTDSummit stuff - Interview with David Allen by Lifehacking.nl

My very good friend Frank Meeuwsen of "What's the Next Action Blog" fame and now one of the chief editors of [Lifehacking.nl](http://lifehacking.nl/) blog (the biggest community of "Lifehackers" in the Netherlands, aka Holland) did a great interview with David Allen before the GTD Summit in San Francisco. The intro by Frank is in Dutch, but the rest is in English, so no worries.
