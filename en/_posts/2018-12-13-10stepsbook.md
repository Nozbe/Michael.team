# BOOK LAUNCH - 10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity

Yes, it’s today that my new book, [“10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity”][b] starts [pre-sale on Amazon][ba] and is being available for order. Shipping will start on January 2. It’s [based on my video course by the same name](https://sliwinski.com/10steps) but the book is a completely-rewritten content, much enhanced and written in such a way, that anyone can grab it and start creating their own productivity system in minutes... and hopefully have an amazing 2019. Here’s how to get the book:

## Get it from our web site: [ProductivityCourse.com][b]

The best way to get the book is to go directly to its dedicated web site - you’ll learn all about the 10 steps (as in - 10 chapters) from the book and why you should definitely get it :-)

## We offer 3 versions of the book:

* **Paperback** (through [Amazon USA][ba], [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Steps-Ultimate-Productivity-Including-Practical-ebook/dp/B07L43376J/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544710936&sr=8-1&keywords=10+steps+to+ultimate+productivity) and [Amazon Germany](https://www.amazon.de/Steps-Ultimate-Productivity-Michael-Sliwinski/dp/8394508650/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1544710961&sr=8-1))
* **eBook** (through [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Steps-Ultimate-Productivity-Including-Practical-ebook/dp/B07L43376J/?tag=sliwinski-20) and [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/910897))
* **Audiobook** (available on Audible on January 15, 2019)

## We also offer the book in “Productivity Package”

Even though the book is not a [Nozbe][n] manual, there are references to Nozbe throughout the book and I believe it’s best if you get both a book and a Nozbe account, so if you get a [Nozbe Solo account for a year][bp] you’ll get both the book and ebook as a bonus :-)

This way you get both the best piece of software and and the best source of inspiration for your future productivity, right?

## Businesses get the book, too!

If you [decide to give Nozbe Business a try](https://nozbe.com/business), we’ll ship the books to each and every member of your team. This way you’ll be able to integrate Nozbe into your productivity workflow faster - as all of your team members will be inspired to get more productive.

## We give $1 off each copy for charity

As you know, [at Nozbe we give 3% of our profits to charity](https://sliwinski.com/charity) so giving back is really dear to my heart.

That’s why with each copy of the book (sold or shipped to customers) we’re donating $1 for charity. We’ll be reporting regularly on book shipments on our [Nozbe blog](https://nozbe.com/blog) with exact info on which charities we’re supporting and why.
