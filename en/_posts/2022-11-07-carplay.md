# CarPlay is why auto makers should just give up on infotainment systems

Last week I was on short holidays with my family and I rented a car. They upgraded me to a BMW 3 series combi (wagon) which was perfect for my familyâ€™s needs. This was a new car and I havenâ€™t driven the newest BMWs lately so I was kind of concerned if Iâ€™ll get around to understand their infotainment system. Luckily all I had to figure out was how to connect my [iPhone Mini](/mini13) with Bluetooth to the system and I was set, as the car was equipped with wireless CarPlay. Hereâ€™s why it was brilliant:

## With CarPlay I have everything I know and love at my fingertips!

I have all three navigation apps: Waze, Google Maps and Apple Maps. I can play music with the Apple Music. I can listen to podcasts in Overcast and I can listen to Audiobooks with Audible. And I can call people directly from my address book. Using audio calling or WhatsApp or whatever.

## Thanks to CarPlay, I feel like at home again!

My main family car back at home also has CarPlay so Iâ€™m completely used to it. Now Iâ€™m in a foreign country, renting a car I donâ€™t really know well and yet, I feel familiar, because I have the same CarPlay so I have basically the same options I have at home.

I donâ€™t need to figure out if the car has navigation system or how it works (and how crappy the input there works!). And most of all, I donâ€™t need to hold my phone in any way while Iâ€™m driving the car. I just connect it to charge if necessary and drive the car, interacting with apps from the phone right on the dashboard.

## Using systems like CarPlay (or Android Phone) makes all the infotainment systems look familiar. The car feels familiar!

And thatâ€™s the key ðŸ”‘.

The car feels familiar and as powerful as my car back at home. I am in control.

So really, all the car makers should focus on supporting these two (are there any more?) phone-based infotainment systems and should completely give up on their systems, which are always too old when they hit the market. Thereâ€™s no point in doing anything else. I always have my [iPhone](/iphone) with me so it should be the starting point to use the car.

Itâ€™s safer, nicer and more powerful. Itâ€™s just better.

## P.S. If you donâ€™t have wireless CarPlay, but only wired, thereâ€™s a hackâ€¦

My car at home is a 2017 model and it doesnâ€™t have wireless CarPlay yet, but thanks to [this dongle][d] it does now. The dongle costs a little over 100 EUR but itâ€™s worth it. Itâ€™s a little flakey sometimes and thereâ€™s a noticeable lag, but itâ€™s great for shorter trips when I donâ€™t want to connect my iPhone with cable each time. I can keep the phone in my pocket and just use CarPlay.
