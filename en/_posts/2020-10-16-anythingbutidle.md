# On “Anything But Idle” commenting on Apple Special Event (iPhone 12 launch)

I was invited by two of my favorite [productivity](/productivity) podcasters: Augusto Pinaud and Ray Sidney-Smith to their show to discuss the recent launch of iPhone 12 and how these new devices hopefully will help us get stuff done better.

It was a blast of a show. We had fun geeking out and had a fair balance between Ray, who’s more Google-centric and Augusto and me who are Apple fanboys.
