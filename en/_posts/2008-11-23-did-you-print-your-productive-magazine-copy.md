# Did you print your Productive Magazine copy?


It's Sunday and a weekly review day for me... but I'm still excited about our launch of the magazine... which is constantly pulling a nice healthy 1K downloads per day without any big promotion activities yet! (Thanks to everyone who downloaded!) **Did you think about PRINTING it out?** We've done our best to make sure the magazine is quite printer-friendly and so we've focused on not including too many background images (and not too few, so that the magazine still looks beautifully). I've heard from some of the readers that they've had a great success printing out the magazine and they've included it in their "weekend readership" lists. Have a great read! A cup of tea, nice armchair and the first issue of the Productive Magazine - how about that? How about ordering a PRINTED version from lulu? Since our magazine is one big (and successful so far) experiment, I decided to also play around at lulu.com and see how it turns out printed. I've prepared two versions:

## 1. [Full-color Productive Magazine with Full-color cover](http://www.lulu.com/content/5026157)

## 2. [Black and White version with Full-color cover](http://www.lulu.com/content/5027220)

We've tried to set the price bar low and we're just getting a few bucks on these printouts to dedicate towards the second edition of the magazine. I just want to know if any of you would be interested in this kind of non-digital distribution. Please let me know!

It's [$19.95 for the full color version](http://www.lulu.com/content/5026157) and [$12.95 for the Black and White version](http://www.lulu.com/content/5027220) (with full color cover). Remember, you can always [download the PDF version for free and print it out yourself.](http://productivemag.com/) Which will you do? Read on the screen? Print out? Order printed version?
