# Interview with Michael Bungay Stanier of Box Of Crayons - Productive! Show #58


After more than three years I re-connect with a great coach, speaker, innovation expert and the co-founder of Box of Crayons -- Michael Bungay Stanier. In the interview, Michael explains what exactly is a great work and why a good work isn't as good as one would think. We also talk about the challenges and fear related to doing a great work and... how great it is to be called Michael :) You can read my interview with Michael in the new re-launched Productive! Magazine issue #3:[ProductiveMag.com](http://www.ProductiveMag.com) Watch the video and see if you and your organization are ready for a "great work challenge".
