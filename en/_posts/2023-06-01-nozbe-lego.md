# Nozbe logo as a Lego mosaic - a fantastic gift from Augusto Pinaud!

As I mentioned last month [I finally met my friend Augusto Pinaud](/augusto) in person. What I didn't say is that he gave me a special gift - knowing that I love ❤️ these two things: [LEGO](/lego) + [Nozbe](/nozbe/) he gifted me with this beautiful mosaic, which he designed especially for me using [Brick.me](https://brick.me){:target='_blank'} service:

## What a great gift!

I'm so happy with this gift - I didn't expect anything like this  - and I must say Augusto hit the bull's eye! What do you give as a gift for someone who really doesn't need anything?

> Something special, knowing what this person truly loves in his life. Something that person wouldn't have the time or idea to get for himself.

That's a perfect recipe for a perfect gift. Here's the set as I got it:

## Step 1. Get the shapes and edges right!

After I unboxed it, I proceeded to first dealing with the edges of the [Nozbe][n] logo to make sure I get them just right:

## Step 2. Fill in the blanks!

Now came the hard part. I had to fill in the colors of each empty space. It's a tedious task which as a [productivity](/productivity) expert I procrastinated for a while… until a good friend of mine visited me with his kids. I decided to turn to illegal child labor and inspire (as in: use) them to help me with the project:

Both the kids and their father got really motivated and they finished the project in no time!

## Step 3. Enjoy the creation proudly in the [home office](/office)!

Now I have a beautiful [LEGO](/lego) set next to my other ones ([Porsche GT3 RS](/gt3), [McLaren F1 Car](/mclaren) and a Bonsai tree) as a great background on my wall:

## Thank you, [Augusto](/augusto)!

## P.S. Improvements to hanging it on the wall

After a week or so the glue that this set came with started giving away and as the set consists of four independent parts, I've decided to improve the way it's attached to the wall. Firstly I connected the four parts with a few original LEGO bricks, secondly I added a grey "frame" to further reinforce the design and thirdly I added two "hooks" with which I attached the whole thing to the wall. Now it should stick there no problem. All my improvements are marked in yellow:
