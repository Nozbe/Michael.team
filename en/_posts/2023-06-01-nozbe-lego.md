# Nozbe logo as a Lego mosaic - a fantastic gift from Augusto Pinaud!

As I mentioned last month [I finally met my friend Augusto Pinaud](/augusto) in person. What I didn't say is that he gave me a special gift - knowing that I love ❤️ these two things: [LEGO](/lego) + [Nozbe](/nozbe/) he gifted me with this beautiful mosaic, which he designed especially for me using [Brick.me](https://brick.me){:target='_blank'} service:

## What a great gift!

I'm so happy with this gift - I didn't expect anything like this  - and I must say Augusto hit the bull's eye! What do you give as a gift for someone who really doesn't need anything?

> Something special, knowing what this person truly loves in his life. Something that person wouldn't have the time or idea to get for himself.

That's a perfect recipe for a perfect gift. Here's the set as I got it:

## Step 1. Get the shapes and edges right!

After I unboxed it, I proceeded to first dealing with the edges of the [Nozbe][n] logo to make sure I get them just right:

## Step 2. Fill in the blanks!

Now came the hard part. I had to fill in the colors of each empty space. It's a tedious task which as a [productivity](/productivity) expert I procrastinated for a while… until a good friend of mine visited me with his kids. I decided to turn to illegal child labor and inspire (as in: use) them to help me with the project:

Both the kids and their father got really motivated and they finished the project in no time!

## Step 3. Enjoy the creation proudly in the [home office](/office)!

Now I have a beautiful [LEGO](/lego) set next to my other ones ([Porsche GT3 RS](/gt3), [McLaren F1 Car](/mclaren) and a Bonsai tree) as a great background on my wall:

## Thank you, [Augusto](/augusto)!
