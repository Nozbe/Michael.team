# I also work like this: 30 Minutes

Ever since I learned about the ["Un-schedule" calendar and the "Pomodoro Technique"][p] I've been dividing my days into 30-minute chunks. Some days are better, others are worse but thanks to the 30-minute slots I can quickly get back to being productive. **[30 Minutes](http://massivegreatness.com/30-minutes)**

I'll talk more about these concepts in my upcoming 10-step productivity course but I believe dividing days into 30-minute chunks helps a lot. MG Siegler writes about 30-minute meetings and I also love these. This cuts the "chit-chat" to minimum and helps all the parties focus on the real thing. Good one, MG.
