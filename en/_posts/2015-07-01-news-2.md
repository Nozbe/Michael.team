# Ask Me Anything. Yes, seriously :-)

*Note: This post is a transcript of my "Passionate Productivity" newsletter which I send to people who read my book "It's all about Passion!" - if you want to be receiving weekly emails from me in the future, [get the book by signing up](/newsletter) - thank you!*

A while ago, when you downloaded my [book on passion][p], you agreed I could email you every now and then, so I'm sending you this short message today to give you an opportunity to:

**AMA - Ask Me Anything - just reply to this email!**

Last month we had [a big Nozbe promo][n] celebrating our 8 years in business. It ended precisely on my birthday (May 20) so I decided to give my Nozbe customers a few gifts, and one of them was an invitation to “ask me anything”.

And they did! I responded to hundreds of emails with questions from people from all over the world! It was amazing.

Some of the most common questions I got:

* *What drives you?*

… and the answer to that is in my book: [“It’s All About Passion”][p]

* *How you started Nozbe?*

… and I answer this not only in my book, but also in [this “interview”][i]

* *Which apps I use to get it all done?*

… basically [Nozbe, Evernote and Dropbox][a]

And many, many more.

Now, if you missed on the Nozbe promo email and didn’t get the chance to ask me anything, now you can - just hit reply and start asking questions!

And before you do, you might want to [check my blog][b] - I’ve been posting regularly this month, including [new episodes][s] of the Productive! Show, new issue of Productive! Magazine with mentor and friend of mine - [Simon Grabowski][m], my [Apple Watch][w] experiences…

...and a [new podcast][t] (called: “The Podcast”) I launched with Radek, VP of Apple Technologies at Nozbe.

Anyway, get your questions ready and Ask Me Anything if you wish!

Have a great rest of the week!

P.S. You can Ask Me Anything in the comments to this post, as well :-)
