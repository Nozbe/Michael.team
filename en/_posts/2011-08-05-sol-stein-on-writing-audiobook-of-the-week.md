# Sol Stein on Writing - audiobook of the week


Recently I picked up a book that had nothing to do with Business, Internet… or Productivity… and on the other hand had a lot to do with both: I picked up what's considered the best book on writing… as I want to improve my writing skills:

> Get this book on: [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V59Z1M?tag=sliwinski-20) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312254210?tag=sliwinski-20)

## I'm writing three books right now…

Well, I have three book projects opened up and started at this point. All three are non-fiction books that cover startups and internet business… and productivity (of course). I should finish the first book (which I started last - go figure…) quite soon, so stay tuned.

That's why I decided to "read" a book on writing to learn some new skills and listen to the "Master Editor" himself. I wasn't disappointed.

## Sol Stein talks more about fiction… but refers to non-fiction a lot

A great discovery for me - what makes a non-fiction book work is the same thing that makes the fiction book stick so well… the structure, "suspense" and other aspects of popular bestsellers can be applied to non-fiction, too. Books on business shouldn't be boring, right?

## Many techniques… and I'll have to listen again for sure :-)

Before I finish up my book I'll definitely listen to this one again to make sure I follow Sol's advice on revising, cutting content and moving things around. He's talking heavily on reducing "filler-words", repetitions and many aspects of the book that don't bring new value to the table.

## Changing "hats" - reader vs author vs editor dilemma

Sol's constantly challenging authors to actually wear several "hats" when writing their books:

1. Casual book browser - pick up your book and see if it actually interests you when you read the first page

2. Writer - just write - don't stop, just keep on writing and don't edit what you just wrote

3. Editor - print out your book and edit it. Remove stuff, use red pen, be cruel to your book and as objective as can be

4. Reader - read the book and see if it bores you… where you loose focus, where you get distracted…

5. Curator - remove passages that don't add value, choose the best ones, put them in the right order...

## Writing a book is no piece of cake… but I'm determined to do it anyway :-)

That's right - I want to improve my writing skills. [That's why I'm blogging here anyway](http://michaelnozbe.com/losing-time-when-seeking-a-perfect-blog-post). Books are not dead and that's why I'm writing these and I want them to be really good. And short and to the point. Edited masterfully just like Sol Stein has taught me. Good examples of such books in business currently are [Rework by 37signals](http://michaelnozbe.com/review-of-37signals-cookbook-called-rework-ge) and new "The Modern Meeting Standard" by Al Pittampali (now [free on Kindle!](http://www.amazon.com/Read-This-Before-Meeting-ebook/dp/B0057ZER34/ref=sr_1_1_title_1_ke?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1312081267&sr=1-1)). Wish me best of luck and if you're into book writing - go ahead and learn a few things from the master Sol Stein himself.

_Do you write? Do you practice writing? What did you discover recently that improved your writing skills?_
