# People who contributed to my free book: "It's all about Passion" - some really inspiring quotes

Yesterday was a big day. 35th birthday and release of my free book for you all to enjoy. I hope you've accepted my birthday gift and [downloaded the book][b]. Today I updated the [book's web site][b] and added the "Table of Contents" to the site with the most memorable and tweetable quotes. While doing that I added quotes from all of the contributors to my book.

## Email for contributions

You see, last Thursday I emailed a bunch of my online friends, people I admire. I sent them an invitation to contribute to my book. It was really last minute... but so many of them did reply and sent fantastic quotes my way. Here are the best ones, and feel free to share them on Twitter if you like (just click on the birdie icon below the quote you like). Most quotes are longer than 140 characters so [get the book][b] to read them in full:

## I'd like to thank everyone for contributing - I'm so happy and proud :-)

I'd like to also thank Lori Anderson, Nicholas Moon and Krzysztof Wysocki for thorough review and great corrections. Augusto Pinaud for constant support. Magda and Radek of my team for helping me so much with this book... and Tomasz, our CTO for helping me with our web sites.

## Updated to version 1.1

I just updated the book to version 1.1, made a few corrections, formatting changes and most of all, added book cover to the PDF version which apparently is the most popular download (60% PDF, 22% Mobi, 18% ePub).
