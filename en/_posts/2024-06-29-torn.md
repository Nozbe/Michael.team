# Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn - Mime version

I’m in London now and just visiting one of the stores I heard [Natalie Imbruglia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Imbruglia)’s [Torn song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1XWJN3nJo) and it reminded me how impactful this song was on my childhood and how I later loved the Mime version of it which is simply hilarious:

## Torn with Mime and Natalie?

Later on an Amnesty International concert Natalie collaborated with this Mime and produced a great concert. [Watch it on Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2pm2fb){:target='_blank'}.

## Most notable gestures: Torn, lying, dry…

I loved the Mime’s moves like:

- torn 👇🏻☝🏼
- him 👖👇🏻
- lying 👈👉

…and many more. Totally hilarious!

I can’t believe this song is so old and still I remember it so vividly and know all the lyrics. Epic song. Epic mime performance. Epic memory!
