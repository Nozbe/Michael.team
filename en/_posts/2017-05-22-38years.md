# 38 years young - the possibilities are infinite!

This past weekend I turned 38 (Saturday, May 20). Another year. Another number. Creeping up on forty, but still not there yet. In this short post I want to let you know why the number 38 is so important to me and why I'm excited about what's ahead of me.

## 38 means a lot to me... leading to infinity!

For some reason the number 38 has always meant "a lot" to me. Maybe because of the shape of this number - as you can see from my drawing above, it has a lot to do with infinity symbol. This means I'm already plenty old - but on the other there's still a lot of years ahead of me and I'm really excited about the infinite possibilities of the future!

## Family-wise, the serious stuff is coming!

I have three daughters, the oldest is 8, the middle is almost 5 and the youngest is 10 months... so the good stuff is still ahead of me - when they start growing up, becoming teenagers, beoming amazing women... becoming a better version of me. Can't wait to witness this and be a part of their life. This will be exciting and heart-breaking...

## Business-wise, I'm just getting started!

[Nozbe turned 10](https://sliwinski.com/link-nozbe10years/) this year, so I've been around the block for a while, but now that I think about it, I've been developing it pretty slowly and cautiously over the last years... and it's time to accelerate this. Too many people are still not well organized... Too many companies and teams are still using email to collaborate... Too many old habits die too hard... so I want to speed things up and double down on Nozbe development and Nozbe marketing. We've got great things up our sleeve and I can't wait to share them with you. The future years of Nozbe will get really exciting!

## 38 is just a number!

I feel very young, I'm probably in the best shape of my life (and a next triathlon race next weekend!) and I've got really exciting stuff to work on. I'm so grateful and thankful to everyone who crossed my path so far and can't wait to keep changing the world with you all.

P.S. Having birthday in this day and age is also fun because you get wishes from all over the world on Facebook and other social media channels. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart!

***Question:*** *What are your thoughts when your birthday hits?*
