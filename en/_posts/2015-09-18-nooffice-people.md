# Do you need to be an introvert to work remotely?

Today while we were recording the 15th episode of [The Podcast][tp] Radek asked me a question: "why do you like working from home so much when you're clearly an extrovert?". That's a good question and I have two things to say about this:

**Extroverts like me have more energy in the afternoons**. Just think about it, most people when they come from work they are tired. And they don't want to see anyone. I'm quite the contrary. I work from my home office so I don't get the human interaction all that much. So I'm actually looking forward to meeting people in the evenings. I have the energy to spend time with my friends and family and plan the time "after work". 

**I'm more connected than you think**. Thanks to Skype, FaceTime, iMessage and also Slack chats or Nozbe comments I'm actually more connected to my colleagues than you might think. I don't feel like I'm all alone in my home office. I feel like I'm part of a team. And that feels good. 

Want to know more? Subscribe to [The Podcast][tp] and in the next episode (which we'll publish next Wednesday) we'll talk more about all the aspects and urban legends concerning teleworking. Stay tuned. 

***Question:*** *Did you ever work from home?*
