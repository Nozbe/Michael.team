# Let's give thanks and donate to help buy computer equipment for orphans! [on: Nozbe blog]

Today is Thanksgiving. It's about being thankful for what we've got. For people we have around us. To me it's also a day when I think what I can do to help others, who are less fortunate than me. In one of my past blog posts I explained that at [Nozbe][n] we have a policy of putting away a [certain percentage of our profits to charity every month.](/charity) and last week we've [used some of this money to help orphans get computer equipment][s] - and today, in the spirit of Thanksgiving I'd like to encourage you to **[donate to EneDue.org][e]** and do your part. Thanks!

> "The long story is that my friend Karol Zielinski, has been running this thing for 3 years now, where he’s been collecting money to buy gifts for the children in orphanages. This year is a little different because he wants to buy computer equipment for these kids and teach them programming skills."

> "I vouch for this cause because I know Karol personally and I know that all of the money he raises we’ll be spent on the stuff for the kids."
