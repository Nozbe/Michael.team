# The Podcast #10 - The Incentives Are Aligned

New episode of your [favorite weekly podcast][p] about "technology, productivity tips, business, publishing, and whatever else comes to mind..." is out! This time we discuss more productivity topics and my recent blog post about [hate mail](https://sliwinski.com/feedback). And yes I used a template to write this very announcement:

What I really liked about this episode is the fact we discussed how your customer relationship is different when you're doing a typical "client work" and when you're running a subscription based business like [Nozbe][n] when your customers effectively become your partners-in-crime. And how this impacts our motivation and productivity.
