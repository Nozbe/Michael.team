# 20 000 downloads in the first week. I'm psyched!


When we launched the magazine I was hoping for a great reception from the "productivity blogosphere" and I was dreaming of reaching a goal of 10K downloads total of the first issue of the magazine. When in the first 24 hours passed with exactly 1000 downloads, I was very optimistic about our goal... but I never expected this:

## 20,000 downloads in a week!

That's right, in a little over a week (a week and a few hours) 20K busy professionals downloaded our first inaugural issue of the Productive! Magazine and the counter keeps on running!


## Today is Thanksgiving so it's a perfect time to THANK YOU MY READERS for contributing to this success!

Let me assure you we won't fail you and deliver an even better issue #2 of the Magazine. You can expect it in January 2009. We're already working on it.

**Happy Thanksgiving!**

P.S. Make sure to recommend Productive! Magazine to your friends and family. After all, everyone wants to be more productive, right?
