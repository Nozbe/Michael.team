# Kindle before bed instead of iPhone

I've recently had trouble falling asleep. 😴 On average I'm sleeping fewer hours than last year. So I decided to fix my "good night" routine by getting rid of my [iPhone](/iphone) for the night and changing it for a [book read](/books) on a [Kindle][k] - here's why…

## Why book instead of a smartphone?

All studies show that the glaring light of a smartphone doesn't help calm us down. Also, what we tend to read on such a device is usually short-form dopamine-enduring content and not slow reads like a book. Again, not good.

So my new routine is this:

Before I go to bed, I pick up my [iPhone Air](/air) and do my [evening journaling](/journal) on it and then put it away for the night on a [MagSafe charger](/magsafe).

Then I pull out my brand new [Kindle Paperwhite][k] which I have set up in dark mode and I read a book. When I feel I'm getting tired, I put away the thing and fall asleep.

## Why a Kindle instead of a physical book?

With Kindle there's no additional light needed. We can turn off the light in our bedroom and both me and my wife read our books on our Kindles in a dark room.

This calms us down even more…

Yes, my wife is an avid reader and she finally convinced me to get a Kindle and start reading the books and not just resort to [listening to audiobooks](/reading-audiobooks-and-absorbing-content/).

It will take a few weeks for the new routine to be automatic, but a few days in, I'm already happy with how it works. And my sleep score seems to be improving.

I took advantage of the Black Friday sale and got the [Kindle at a 20% discount and got the one without ads][k].

How about you? What's your healthy "good night" routine?
