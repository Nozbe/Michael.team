# How to go paperless in three steps - Productive Show 52

I always wanted to go paperless but I never really took the plunge. Finally in January this year I decided to finally do it and I'm so glad I did. Now I have access to all of my documents from any device as I have everything stored in Evernote. And as [Nozbe][n] integrates with Evernote, I can also access them from within my task manager. In this episode I'll show you exactly what I did :-)
