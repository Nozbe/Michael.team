# 120,000 views of the Productive Magazine on Issuu

I've never payed attention to the number of views the [Productive Magazine got on Issuu.com](http://issuu.com/nozbe) but when I checked them eariler today they blew my mind! Productive Magazine issue [#1 with David Allen just passed 100,000 views](http://issuu.com/nozbe/docs/productive_magazine_01) and Productive Magazine issue [#2 with Guy Kawasaki is closing 20,000 views](http://issuu.com/nozbe/docs/productive_magazine_02) Let's see how much issue #3 will generate, we're working on it already and I'll keep you posted. Meanwhile if you know anyone who could benefit from reading the Productive Magazine, make sure to let them know and forward them to this page! Thanks! Update: Just checked and our second issue of the magazine is one of the most popular on issuu.com this month, just have a look at the screenshot:
