# Home Office desk rearrangement - flipping monitor position, MacBook Air placement and iPad Pro setup

I keep fine-tuning [my home office](/office) and after [rearranging it for 2023](/office23) and working like this [with the M1 MacBook Air](/ipadmac/) I decided to move some things around and make some more premium room on the desk for my [iPad Pro](/ipadonly/) and the result is this:

## Moving external monitor to the right while putting the MacBook Air at the back of the desk

This small tweak's main goal was to create more space on the desk for the iPad Pro, so that I have this machine right in front of me when I'm working. Additional benefit of moving the screen closer to the window but tilting it towards me, I also reduced glare coming from the outside. The [Sony camera for streaming](/streaming/) has been moved higher so that it doesn't disturb me while I'm working.

Here's the BEFORE and AFTER photo:

Here's how it looks from the cable-management perspective:

The cool thing is that I can still use the M1 MacBook Air's screen when necessary:

## Better frame for both camera recording and zoom video calls

By moving the screen to the right and setting up the Sony camera to the left, I achieved a better frame for both cameras. When I'm recording marketing videos for [Nozbe][n] using the Sony camera, there's a nice wood-style backlit corner behind me. When I'm just talking to people using the Logitech webcam, you can see part of my Whiteboard and the background is much cleaner:

## Keep tweaking your home office, people!

As always, you can [browse through my home office journey](/office/) on this blog and see that I've been tweaking my setup all these years and I'm never 100% satisfied. As my needs change, my gear upgrades and my requirements go up, stuff needs re-thinking each time.

Take a look around your home office and think how you can make it better!
