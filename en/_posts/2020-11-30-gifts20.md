# Gadgets for a geek like me for 2020 Christmas Holiday season

Itâ€™s hard to satisfy a geek like me. I donâ€™t like to buy many things and Iâ€™m very specific about stuff I want. And there are also gadgets that I need. Hereâ€™s the list of things I got on Black Friday or will be getting soon this holiday season (or will be telling my relatives to get for me). Hope itâ€™s useful to you and inspires you to get something for yourself:

<!--More-->

## The 2020 iPhone isâ€¦

* [iPhone mini](/mini/) - I got 128GB black. This year it's the best value in iPhone and the most futuristic phone IMHO.
* [Apple Watch Series 6](/applewatch) is also the Apple Watch to get. I got an aluminium blue one with cellular.

## The iPhone cover?

* **SinjiMoru Wallet** - [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/Sinjimoru-Holder-Wallet-functioning-Credit/dp/B00HY3HSZQ/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/Titular-SINJIMORU-funciona-billetera-smartphone/dp/B00HY3HSZQ/ref=sr_1_7?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/Sinjimoru-aufklebbarer-Kreditkartenhalter-Kartenhalter-Smartphones/dp/B00HY3HSZQ/ref=sr_1_7?tag=sliwinski-20) I'm using the iPhone without any cover, just with a minimalist wallet glued to it. Still works with most wireless chargers.
* **[MagSafe Wallet](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLT3/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-saddle-brown)** I ordered it but it hasn't come over yet. I'm gonna try it.
* **[Mujjo Leather Wallet Case](https://www.mujjo.com/cases/iphone/iphone-12-mini/full-leather-wallet-case-for-iphone-12-mini-monaco-blue)** If I decide to use a cover on my iPhone.

## The cablesâ€¦

A geek needs lots of cables, so I recommend getting these:

* [Spare Apple Watch cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2G2AM/A/apple-watch-magnetic-charging-cable-03m) as I want to be able to charge my watch anywhere. I've tested the compatible non-Apple ones and they're good, too.
* **3-in-1 retractable charging cables** - they're cheap and they charge from USB-A to USB-C, micro-USB and Lightning. I have lots of those at home. [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/ASICEN-Retractable-Charging-Connector-Smartphones/dp/B07X1W93Z5/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/SDBAUX-Aufladung-Einziehbares-Ladekabel-Kompatibel-3-1-Grau/dp/B07ZV3QFR5/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/SDBAUX-RetrÃ¡ctil-MÃºltiples-Compatibles-TelÃ©fonos/dp/B07P8L2946/ref=sr_1_7_mod_primary_lightning_deal?tag=sliwinski-20)
* **Spare USB-C to USB-C cables** and **USB-C to Lightning** cables. Find any cables you like.

## Chargers

Now that we've got new PD (Power Delivery) GaN chargers, it's time to stock up:

* **AUKEY 30W or 36W dual USB-C** [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-AUKEY-Foldable-Delivery-Dynamic/dp/B0833XR41B/ref=sr_1_9?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/AUKEY-Cargador-Delivery-Dynamic-Compatible/dp/B07RVLS4FC/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/AUKEY-Delivery-LadegerÃ¤t-Ladestecker-kompatibel/dp/B07RRMYX6D/ref=sr_1_6?tag=sliwinski-20)
* **Belkin 30W Dual USB-C/USB-A** [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-USB-C-Charger-Lightning-iPhone/dp/B07XW34KLW/ref=sr_1_4?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/Belkin-USB-C-30-Cargador-generaciÃ³n/dp/B07TSB41SW?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/Belkin-USB-C-NetzadegerÃ¤t-iPhone-SchnellladegerÃ¤t-Plus-WeiÃŸ/dp/B07TSB41SW?tag=sliwinski-20)

There are also higher-Watt chargers like "Aukey Omnia" with 65W or even 100W, so make sure to check them out instead of getting the bulky Apple chargers.

## Induction "wireless" chargers:

There's the [MagSafe Charger for the iPhone 12](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXH3/magsafe-charger) for around $40 and the [duo MagSafe Charger for the iPhone and Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXF3AM/A/magsafe-duo-charger) for $120 but these are pretty expensive. Not getting them for now.

I like traditional Qi chargers. The cheap ones from [IKEA - the Livboj model](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/livboj-wireless-charger-black-90447058/) works surprisingly well!

## Microphones

I'm recording much: [The Podcast](/podcast), [No Office FM](/noofficefm) and [webinars](/webinar) so I like to have a good mic:

* **Samson Q2U** - [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-SAQ2UTB-Handheld-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B07K1XSDZP/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/Samson-Q2U-MicrÃ³fono-grabaciÃ³n-escenarios/dp/B0876TR1ZS/ref=sr_1_1?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/Samson-Dynamisches-XLR-Mikrofon-Zuhause-BÃ¼hnenaufnahmen/dp/B0876TR1ZS/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) I've got two of these - one connected to the iMac and one I use with the iPad through a USB-C to mini-USB cable.
* **Shure MV7** - [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸US](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/ref=sr_1_1?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ES](https://www.amazon.es/Shure-retransmisiones-auriculares-aislamiento-certificado/dp/B08G7JN6J7/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªDE](https://www.amazon.de/Shure-Podcast-Mikrofon-Livestreaming-KopfhÃ¶rerausgang-VollmetallgehÃ¤use/dp/B08G7JN6J7/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) this is the one I have on my Christmas list.

## Other gadgets

Here are some other things on my list:

* [Lego "The Child" baby Yoda](https://www.lego.com/product/the-child-75318)
* [Lego Porsche 911 RSR](https://www.lego.com/product/porsche-911-rsr-42096)
