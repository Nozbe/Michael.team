> **Note:** this is a transcript of the email Newsletter I sent to my 1000+ subscribers a while back. If you want to be one of them, [sign up for my free Newsletter. You can unsubscribe anytime!](https://michael.gratis/n){:target='_blank'}

## 5 things I recommend you check out this December:

1. I'm thankful you're still subscribed and I can reach out to you via email. Thanks for being here. [And I argue you should practice gratitude every day!](/thankful/)
2. I've resurrected my **#NoOffice Podcast** and published a great interview with the originator of *Getting Things Done*, [David Allen - it's a short 30-minute conversation that you might enjoy](/noofficefm-43/)
3. I've published [10 things you need in your home office](/office-things/) and a full [home office video walkthrough](/office-walkthrough/) - with hopefully many great ideas for Christmas üéÑ gifts üéÅ for yourself or your friends.
4. Speaking of gifts. Why not get something the inner child of you likes? [Like a great LEGO set?](/gt3/)
5. How to focus on the positive and look at everything with a glass-half-full mentality? [Don't fall for the missing cup holder bias](/cup-holder/)

## Back to blogging regularly!

Apart from these 5 things, you might have noticed that I'm getting into the habit of writing almost daily on my blog, so make sure to check out my recent posts - [you might find some of them really useful!](/archive/)

Anyway, now let's try to get back to a regular cadence of writing to you and if you have any suggestions, questions or comments what I should cover next, do let me know!

Yours productively,

- Michael Sliwinski, the founder of [Nozbe](/nozbe/)

P.S. Apart from this Newsletter, I've lately been more active [on LinkedIn](https://michael.gratis/in) where I've set up a weekly [Newsletter that's different than this one!](https://michael.gratis/inn) so make sure to subscribe to both!
