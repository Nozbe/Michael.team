# My favorite USB-C gadgets of 2025

In one of my earlier blog posts I mentioned that now I'm striving to get [USB-C all things](/usbc), meaning whenever I get a new gadget it must be powered using just a standard USB-C cable. This way I don't collect useless additional chargers and can always add juice to my devices. Practical and environmentally friendly. Here are my top picks for this year and great ideas for gifts for nerds like me - send this list to your partners, people.

## AAA and AA USB-C Li-ion batteries

Most people don't know these things exist. But they do. And they are awesome. I'm gradually changing all my previous Ni-MH rechargeable batteries to these ones.

![{{ page.title }} aa](/img/usbc25-aaa.jpg)

Not only do they add USB-C charging, but they are also much modern using Li-ion and NOT Ni-MH technology. They come with this cute 4-in-1 USB-C charging cable and they can quickly recharged. I will only be buying these batteries from now on. Hare are links to some of the popular [AA batteries](https://amzn.to/44nVxOD) and [AAA ones](https://amzn.to/3JVon22).

## SUPRENT Beard trimmer (not Braun!)

I've been rocking a beard for the last 6 years and I've been trimming it using a Braun trimmer which I still have at home. However, for travel I bought a new trimmer which is USB-C powered and looks like a Braun knock-off (the same length dial and basic design).

![{{ page.title }} trimmer](/img/usbc25-trimmer.jpg)

To me, Braun brand will be irrelevant if they don't switch to USB-C at some point. I got the [SUPRENT beard trimmer and it's great](https://amzn.to/4oUey3n).

## HOTO screwdrivers

In my house there's always something to fix and something to screw in so now I'm using two sets of HOTO screwdrivers. One for the [bigger stuff (furniture, wall, etc)](https://amzn.to/4rj2lHg) and [one for the smaller stuff (computers and electricity)](https://amzn.to/4inIYJa).

![{{ page.title }} hoto](/img/usbc25-hoto.jpg)

They are very well made, charge via USB-C (duh!) and have all the necessary magnetic bits to screw everything in or out.

## INIU 3-in-1 travel Qi2 charger

I'm about to travel to the US for a few days and I'm taking this very compact travel charger. With this one device I can charge my [iPhone Air](/air), [AirPods Pro 3](/airpodspro) and [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra).

![{{ page.title }} 3in1](/img/usbc25-3in1.jpg)

There are many compact 3-in-1 chargers on the market now, but this one has been throughly tested by one of my trusted YouTubers ([MobileReviewsEh](https://www.youtube.com/@MobileReviewsEh)) and he considers it as the best one. [Around $40 bucks on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4ieBEPK).

## AIRPODS 3 Pro headphones

The third generation of [AirPods Pro](/airpods) headphones doesn't disappoint. They are better in almost every way. Better noise cancellation, longer range when connected to my devices and quicker switching between them. I use them every day and keep them in my pants pocket at all times. I also love how convenient it is to charge them. Not only using USB-C cable, but also MagSafe and Apple Watch inductive charging. You can find them [discounted on Amazon](https://amzn.to/48ur57U).

## BEATS Solo 4 Wireless

Speaking of headphones, this one is not for me, but for my daughters. All of my girls (including my wife) have these headphones. My elder ones have Beats Solo 3 Wireless (earlier model) and my youngest will receive the latest model this Christmas. They don't have noise-canceling but as they are on-ear headphones they block enough noise from the outside. They are very sturdy and even when they break, [they can be easily fixed](/soda/). They have Apple's special chip so they easily connect to my daughters' iPhones and iPads. Perfect travel companions. They are not very cheap but very often [they are on sale on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3XeDTck) and then they're totally worth getting for the kids.

## JBL Clip 4 or 5 Bluetooth speakers

Whenever we travel as a family, we must carry at least one Bluetooth speaker and my favorite one is the [JBL Clip series of speakers](https://amzn.to/3LXOi9N). We have a few of them. They have this handy carabiner built in, so I can attach it to my backpack or to my wife's purse or to anything in a hotel room so that we can listen to some music when on the go. For such a small speaker the sound is pretty cool… and they come in many different colors.

## LOGITECH MX Anywhere 3s mouse

I love this small but powerful mouse. It works great for both right and left handed people. And even though I'm right-handed [I learned to use my mouse with left hand](/mouse/) and I have the Apple's trackpad on the right side of my keyboard. I bought two of these mice - a [black one for myself](https://amzn.to/3Km7HRl) and a [rose for my wife](https://amzn.to/4ptqEAz).

![{{ page.title }} logi](/img/usbc25-logi.jpg)

On the picture above you can see the entire set, together with my [Logitech Ergo keyboard and Apple Trackpad with LEGO stand](/ergo/).

## KINDLE Paperwhite ebook reader

As I've already mentioned, [I replaced iPhone with Kindle](/kindle) as my go-to *before-bed* reading device. So far so good. I'm loving this single-purpose device for calm reading before falling asleep. I got the [black Paperwhite without ads](https://amzn.to/48szBUZ).

![{{ page.title }} kindle](/img/kindle.jpg)

## ANKER 140W 3 x USB-C charger

This is my new favorite multi-port charger. I travel with it everywhere. It's small, compact and has a retractable plug both [in the USA](https://amzn.to/4iebcpk) and [in Europe](https://amzn.to/4a6QANN). With this charger I can basically charge most of the devices in my family. It has a very nice display that shows which port is using how much Wattage, so you can really see how all of your devices are charging.

## P.S. New iPhone Air with PITAKA case

As notable mention I can't say enough good things about my new [iPhone Air](/air). I've recorded an [entire video review](/air-video) for iMagazine's YouTube channel. I feel like this year everyone's getting the iPhone 17 or the 17 Pro… but they fail to even give the Air a try.

![{{ page.title }} air](/img/usbc25-air.jpg)

Now that I've been using it for the last 2 months I can honestly say that it's the best iPhone ever for me. Every time I pick it up, I smile and I'm surprised how big its screen is compared to how light it feels. I bought a very light aramid-fiber [20g case from PITAKA](https://amzn.to/3JVoCds) for it and even in my small hands, it feels awesome.

## USB-C all things in 2025 and beyond!

I'm so happy EU forced Apple to switch to USB-C on the iPhones. Apple introduced [USB-C to the iPad Pro in 2018](/ipadretro/) and they still had their stupid Lightning port on [iPhone XS](/newdevice/), 11, 12, 13 and 14… It took them 5 years to do it. Talk about customer-hostile behavior.

![{{ page.title }} all](/img/usbc25-all.jpg)

**Now we can choose to have USB-C all things.** This way I can travel with just one multi-port charger and several cables and I can charge all of my gadgets with the same port. No, USB-C is NOT a perfect port, but it's good enough and now it's universal enough and I'm really happy about it. So get yourself or your loved one some cool USB-C gadgets this Christmas! 🎄
