# 11 years and counting - how my daughter is growing and I simply can’t believe it...

Today my first daughter (out of three!) turned 11 (yes, that’s eleven!) and I simply can’t believe it. The same one that [believes I just write random stuff](https://sliwinski.com/dad/) for a living and the same one that [completely changed my life and converted me to a dad](https://sliwinski.com/a-tale-of-a-proud-father-how-my-baby-daughter/). Now she’s eleven and she’s grown... and here are a few things where she completely amazes me:

## My 11 year young Milena is amazing because...

* She's eleven and she's already 150cm tall... and remember that I'm 168cm short... so in a not-so-distance future she'll be taller than me!
* She has a total command of three languages - both in speaking and reading - Polish, English or Spanish? Whatever you throw at her - she takes it. It's unbelievable and it's surreal - skills that took me so many years she's just got them... and she literally swallows books in all three languages without a problem!
* She's a small woman now - with her own opinions, faces, ideas... everything - she's a partner for any conversation right now and it's astounding.
* She's a version 2.0 of a human being - what she does with her iPad is beyond me. She's the most [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly) person I know. She reads, writes, makes presentations, creates animations and slow-mo movies, builds worlds, plays games, sends crazy messages... all with her iPad... I'm starting to take classes from her...
* She has her own style - unlike her mom and her younger sisters, she doesn't really care what she's wearing - she's very individual in that sense...
* She's very ambitious - she learns quickly, she reads fast, she basically inhales knowledge and there's no stopping her... and everything comes easy to her...
* She's impatient (like her mom) and she gets frustrated very quickly... and on top of that she follows rules like no one I know... and she gets truly angry when people don't. When I'm driving I get hard time from her when I'm trying to put my foot down... she's very vigilant...
* She hardly sleeps... I mean she does, but it sometimes feels like it she doesn't need it... she's my personal zombie... especially on a long drive when her sisters are deep asleep... she has her beautiful dark eyes wide open.
* She's my first born and she's my eldest and she'll always be my special daughter... and I simply can't believe she's turning 11 today.

My dear Milena, happy birthday baby, happy 11 and even though you'll become a teenager and a grown woman soon... you'll always be my little princess!
