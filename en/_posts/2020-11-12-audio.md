# Subscribe to my Team Productivity Show as an audio podcast!

Just [yesterday I posted](/officevideo) a 9th episode of the [Team Productivity Show](/tag/vlog) which up until now was only available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4VGcOPPsP4O0dJlcJLoMiGEWSTOFYulO). Now you can enjoy all of the 9 past episodes in an audio form - **[just subscribe to it as a podcast](https://feeds.transistor.fm/team-productivity-show)**.

## Why convert a vlog to a podcast?

Because podcasts are great! You can listen while running, driving, cycling, doing dishes, vacuuming the house… you name it. And while [my last show](/officevideo) was pretty visual, the rest of my past shows and the future ones I'm going to record can be pretty well consumed in audio as well.

> Each episode is short and to the point - usually only 5-10 minutes!

Unlike my other podcasts, which are much longer around 40-60 minutes per episode:

* [The Podcast FM](/tag/podcast/)
* [No Office Podcast](/tag/noofficefm)

Still, you should totally subscribe to them, too!

## How to subscribe to Team Productivity Show Podcast?

The cool thing is that you can just open your podcast app (I recommend [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)) and search for:

> Team Productivity

And you should find it.

Or just [copy and paste this link](https://feeds.transistor.fm/team-productivity-show):

## Thanks and hope to meet you… in your ear!

I'd like to thank my [Nozbe][n] team, especially Marco and Rafal (my co-host of [No Office Podcast](/tag/noofficefm)) for making it happen and helping me convert my vlog to audio.

Anyway, I really have got very ambitious plan for this show, so stay tuned for new episodes both in video and audio!
