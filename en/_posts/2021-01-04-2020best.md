# My best blog posts of 2020

I’m in the middle of my [annual review](/annual) and I’m getting ready to write summary of this past year (as I did [in 2019](/2019) and [in years before that](/yearly)). Before I publish it though, I decided to first reflect on the best blog posts of this past year (you can check [best of 2019 here](/2019best)). I hope you’ll find some of them useful and actionable:

<!--More-->

## I moved my blog from [Sliwinski.com](https://sliwinski.com/) to [Michael.team](/new)

As I'm writing this, I haven't migrated all the posts yet, only [all of the episodes of The Podcast](/podcast) and all of the posts between [2017 and now](/archive). It's not only the domain that has changed, but also the technology behind this site and everything else - I want this blog to be my [new playground for new things](/new) (and a place where I post [at least once a week](/once-a-week/)).

## In 2020 I became a multi-podcaster!

In 2020 we published only 13 episodes of [The Podcast](/podcast) as we had a half-year break. Among other things, we chatted about [making shield masks](/podcast-206), my new concept of [core hours](/podcast-204), the [subtle art of not caring as much](/podcast-201) and we held our [200 episode spectacular](/podcast-200).

I'm hoping in 2021 we'll get back to it on a 1-2 times per month schedule.

Apart from that with my VP of Product at [Nozbe][n] we launched two [#NoOffice](/nooffice) podcasts:

- [No Office FM](/noofficefm) in English
- [Nie Ma Biura](/pl/niemabiura) in Polish

I especially recommend the episodes about [Dogfooding](/noofficefm-3), how our [virtual reunion happened](/noofficefm-6) and the ["Weekend Wednesday" concept](/noofficefm-8).

And I launched [Team Productivity Show](/vlog) and I'm trying to publish at least one video show per month.

## On this site I launched some useful small projects:

**[YouTube watcher](/yt/)** which helps watch videos [without being tracked](/youtube/).

**[Virtual Dice](/dice/)** to use when [playing board games](/rolling).

Both projects (just as this entire web site) are completely responsive, so you can enjoy them on a computer and on a smartphone and on everything in between.

## I shared some back-stage how we do stuff at [Nozbe][n]:

I wrote [how an idea is born](/idea) and I can't wait to show it to you once it's implemented. I had to write about the [Coronavirus and how to deal with it](/covid/) and how we're [relaxing our work policy](/coronavirus) because of it. I also shared the [17 commandments of work](/17/) and how they'll guide us to make a better product. Especially now that we launched [Nozbe Teams and became a two-product company](/two/).

## I almost finished the [#NoOffice book](/nooffice)

[The Covid pandemic motivated me to do it](/nooffice-writing/). As of today I'm at 78% now with 24 chapters written ([you can read free online!](https://NoOffice.org/)). I started [writing seriously in August](/10chapters/) and I [posted a video update](/nooffice1vlog) but I slowed down recently. I'm planning to finish writing in January of this year.

In the same open source spirit I published the [#iPadOnly book](/ipadonlyfree/) for [free to read as well](https://ipadonly.com/book/).

## I got a few new gadgets this year

I decided to go with the [iPhone 12 Mini](/mini) and I love it so far. I [celebrated 10 years of iPad](/ipad) with a new iPad Pro and the [Magic Keyboard](/backlit) of which I made a [video review](/magic). It's by far my best [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly) gadget!

[I completely redesigned my home office](/office) - with [video walkthrough](/officevideo) and lots of [detailed photos and description of it](/myoffice).

## Other posts I'm proud of:

* [Design principles by Dieter Rams](/designed)
* RIP posts for [Wunderlist](/wunderlist), [Clay and Kobe](/clay-kobe) and [my uncle](/uncle).
* [New journaling routine with iA Writer and Siri Shortcuts](/journal20).
* And [regular updates](/now-updates) to my ["now" page](/now).

Please [let me know](/contact) what your favorite post of 2020 was - either on this blog or that you read anywhere else!
