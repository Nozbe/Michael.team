# 9 reasons why I ditched my beloved iPhone 13 Mini for the 15 Pro

This year I've upgraded both of my most mobile devices. [Apple Watch](/applewatch/) got upgraded to the beefy [Ultra 2](/ultra) from a small series 7 and the [iPhone](/iphone) went from the cute [Mini 13](/mini13) to the **iPhone 15 Pro**. Here are all the reasons that finally convinced me to drop the [small and powerful](/mini13ultra/) Mini for the latest iPhone Pro:

## What I've been missing in the iPhone 13 Mini

I loved Mini's size and weight. It's so light yet still such a great smartphone. I actually "downgraded" to it from the [iPhone 13 Pro](/iphone13/) because of these features. When I did, I sacrificed three things:

1. Pro-motion 120Hz display - smooth scrolling!
2. 3X telephoto lens - better photos!
3. Battery life - duh!

While I could live without those things, whenever I'd use my wife's iPhone 13 Pro Max, I'd envy her the smoother scrolling a little. Even though the Mini 13 had a better battery life than Mini 12, it still didn't last me an entire day. I also missed the telephoto - especially when taking pictures of my daughters.

## Which new features did the iPhone 14 Pro bring?

I skipped the 14-pro generation of the iPhone, which brought additional features like:

1. Dynamic island üèùÔ∏è 
2. Always-on display
3. 48MP Photo camera

While these features were not deal-breakers, I did want to try them out at some point. Especially I wanted to know if this removal of notch and going for *Dynamic Island* would be a meaningful change. Spoiler alert - it's cool, but it's a gimmick. I was also curious about the always-on display.

But I resisted and kept my Mini‚Ä¶ until the iPhone 15 Pro arrived with 2 key features that convinced me to go for it:

## Lighter iPhone 15 Pro with USB-C!

That's right. The iPhone 15 Pro made of titanium is 20g lighter than its predecessors and a little bit smaller. It's still 40g heavier than the Mini, but it's a welcome improvement. Also, finally USB-C comes to the iPhone, so I can share the same accessories [with my beloved iPad Pro 13"](/ipadv) - **USB-C all things!** I also simplified my [traveling pouch](/pouch/) by removing most of old-school Lightning accessories. I still need to keep some Lightning cables, because my family uses older iPhones or iPads, but it's a great simplification anyway!

The new iPhone also handles better in my hand - it's a little more curvy, feels smaller and better balanced.

## Bonus for the iPhone 15 Pro - Action button!

As a [productivity](/productivity/) guy this is a game changer for me - now I have a programmable "Action Button" on both the [iPhone](/iphone) and the [Watch](/applewatch) and I'm using [Siri Shortcuts](/shortcuts/) to customize it. More on that in future blog posts!

## Which covers do I use with the iPhone 15 Pro?

I use 3 covers with the iPhone 15 Pro (I'm simply too afraid to be using it without a cover):

1. [Spigen Clear MagFit](https://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-15-series-collection/products/iphone-15-series-case-ultra-hybrid-magfit?variant=41717018198063) ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8TS2Z/?tag=sliwinski-20)) - I prefer this case for most of the time. It highlights the Midnight-blue color of my iPhone.
2. [Peak Design Everyday Case](https://eu.peakdesign.com/collections/mobile/products/everyday-case?variant=40139549737037) ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG2DW87R/?tag=sliwinski-20)) - I use it when doing sports, especially when riding a bike. They are now improving the case [to support the Action button](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjc7InZ7D-I) but I still enjoy it anyway.
3. [Mous Limitless 5.0](https://eu.mous.co/products/limitless-5-0-magsafe-compatible-phone-case-aramid_fibre?variant=41167234400349) ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFR1LGD9/?tag=sliwinski-20)) - I'm trying it based on [a YouTuber recommendation](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A-PLD-bCyC4).

All these three covers support my [MagSafe lifestyle](/magsafe) and are compatible with my minimalist [iWallet](/iwallet/).

## 9 new features of the iPhone 15 Pro vs the iPhone 13 Mini

So to re-cap I'm getting 9 new features with the iPhone 15 Pro upgrade:

- 3 x iPhone 13 Pro features: ProMotion display, 3X telephoto lens and better battery life
- 3 x iPhone 14 Pro features: Dynamic Island, Always-on display and 48MP camera
- 3 x iPhone 15 Pro features: lighter weight, USB-C and Action Button!

Yep, for a tech enthusiast like me these additional 9 features are more than worth the upgrade. While iPhone 14 Pro features were nice-to-have's, it's the iPhone 15 Pro with it's fundamental design changes that pushed me over the edge to get it.

After almost 2 months with the iPhone 15 Pro I must say I still miss the size and cuteness of thee iPhone Mini, but the new stuff makes up for it in spades!

Now with both the **iPhone 15 Pro** and [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra/) my new mobile setup is glorious:
