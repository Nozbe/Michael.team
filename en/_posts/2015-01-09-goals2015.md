# How I'm setting my goals for 2015 to get them all done

Now that [year 2014](/2014/) is behind us, it's time to focus on 2015 and set some goals for it. I don't believe in New Year's Resolutions but in [setting real goals as projects](https://sliwinski.com/new-years-resolutions-for-2010-gtd-style/) and in this post I'm going to show you how I've done my goals for this year:

If you're a [Nozbe][n] user, you might have seen [this post by Michael Hyatt about setting goals as projects][mh]. If not, I strongly encourage you to check it out. And if you haven't checked out Michael's course: [5 Days to Your Best Year Ever][mc] - the registration closes tonight, so make sure to check it out. I won't earn a dime if you do, I'm linking to his course because it's great and because it works. Anyway, I've followed [Michael's advice written in his post for Nozbe][mh] and this is what I did:



## I have my 8 goals for 2015 set up as my 8 projects

I created 8 projects as my 8 goals for 2015. Here's how I did it:

* Each project's name goes like this: **Goal X - Name** - where X is the number of the goal and the name is the actual name of the goal, for example: *Goal 7 - Fitness*
* I added a description for each goal to make it as specific as possible, as well as time-bound: *Go down to 63kg / 22 BMI - with lean muscle growth. Complete 5 triathlons, 5 x 10km and 1 half-marathon*
* Each project/goal has a label "goals" so I can filter out them on my project list easily.
* Also all of my goals have a distinct color (orange) so that they stand out on my project list

This is exactly what [Michael Hyatt recommends in his article][mh].

## I added specific tasks to each goal

To make sure a goal happens, you need an action plan. These are your steps that will help you get the goal done. I added my tasks to each of the goals.

## I've used comments to add more specifics to each task

In Nozbe you can add comments to a task so I used that feature to add more information on each step. Sometimes I'd just explain what that particular task meant. Other times I added a more detailed checklist. Very often I'd even add deadlines in the comments for each task - when it needs to get done.

Now that I think about it, I might just use the "date" field for each task as a deadline. Yep, that's a good idea.

Anyway, my goal here was to be specific what I wanted to achieve, for example in my "Triathlons" task there is a checklist of all the triathlons that I want to participate in this year. You can't get more specific than that, right?

## I'm going to review my goals every week

This is crucial. I've created this in order to review my goals every week during my [weekly review](https://sliwinski.com/getting-weekly-review-done-after-2-months/). If you don't review your goals regularly and plan every week to do something towards their completion... you're going to fail... and failure is not an option! :-)

## What are your goals for 2015?

I've got 8 goals for this year, where 4 of them are [Nozbe][n] related as I want to take my business to a whole new level this year. I'm very excited for 2015, it's going to be a great year.

***Question:*** *What are your goals? How are you going to achieve them? Have you checked [Michael's][mh] blog post? If not, what are you waiting for? :-)*
