# Newsletter is back! After many years of silence…

Now that I finally finished writing the long-awaited [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/){:target=‘_blank’}, I decided to go back to sending you a regular Newsletter after more than two years of not doing that ([actually it’s been over 5 years!](/news-6/)). Isn't that exciting?

**Note:** this is a transcript of the email Newsletter I sent to my 1000+ subscribers on Tuesday, September 28. If you want to be one of them, [sign up for my free Newsletter. You can unsubscribe anytime!](/news/)

## You still get two eBooks as a thank you!

Before I continue, a short reminder that you subscribed to my email Newsletter list to read my two eBooks - [It's All About Passion](/passion) and [No Office Apps](/apps)

## Updates from me for the last quarter of 2021

I want to keep this message short and sweet - if you want to receive updates from me, please stay on. If you don't want to hear from me, just unsubscribe using the link at the end of the message.

Now, in the meantime I migrated my blog from [Sliwinski.com](https://sliwinski.com/) to [Michael.team](/) and started posting more regularly and writing more.

I also launched a [No Office podcast in English](/noofficefm/) and [Nie Ma Biura podcast in Polish](/pl/niemabiura). Hope you're subscribed!

As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I finally got motivated to finish writing the **#NoOffice** book and [you can read the first draft free online](https://NoOffice.org/){:target=‘_blank’}.

Last October [I published the first teaser of the book](/nooffice1vlog) and recently [I published the second video](/nooffice2vlog) about the book.

Now I'm planning to start a **#NoOffice Book Launch Team** and I hope you'll be part of it. More details soon in the next Newsletter. This fall will be all about promoting this book to help people and teams transitioning from office-centric world to post-pandemic reality where there is No Office.

Because as you very well know:

> "Work is not a place to go, it's a thing to do!" Until next time,

Until next time,

- Michael

## Additional notes after I’ve sent the newsletter

Wow, it’s been 5 years since I contacted people on my mailing list. I’m ashamed I kept people singed up and didn’t send anything even though [I’ve been blogging a lot as you can see from my archives](/archive).

I’ll try to stick to a monthly Newsletter schedule where I sent the message once a month and a week or two later I’ll re-post it on the blog.

I've also created a special page [with all the Newsletter archives](/news).

## Bonus video

P.S. I’ve also recorded a new video for the Newsletter “thank you” page. This is the video you’ll see when you sign up:
