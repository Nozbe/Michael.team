# The Podcast #191 - Summer's Gone

We’re back! After a 3-month hiatus we’re doing a quick re-cap of all the things that happened in our lives between our [The Podcast][p] recordings and from today on we’ll be back on a regular bi-weekly schedule. Many of the things we discussed today will be full-length episodes in the future, so make sure to let me know what you want us to discuss first!

Watch this short teaser and listen to the entire episode below:
