# The Podcast #92 - Fooled by Randomness

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss the book, **Fooled by Randomness** by Nassim Taleb ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V8H28C?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812975219?tag=sliwinski-20)) *The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets* - and it's a pretty rambly and random discussion on how we as people try to make sense of the world without really understanding it. Hope you'll join the conversation and let me know in the comments how you see randomness in your life:
