# The Podcast #189 - Dub dub

Last month on [The Podcast][p] we once again met live with Radek on Apple’s Developer conference WWDC and we actually used Apple’s Podcasting studio to record our show... which was a geek-out exchange about all the new stuff Apple has presented on the conference. This time you may both watch or listen to the entire episode right here, so enjoy:
