## Show notes for this episode:

This is such an important idea. We all know this, but few of us actually internalize this truth: The competition for our time and attention is a zero sum game. No matter how hard you try, a day is 24 hours long. We have to be _brutal_ in refusing to do useful things so we can do _the most _important things. No matter how hard this is, there's no other way to be successful.
