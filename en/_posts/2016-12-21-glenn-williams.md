# Interview with Glenn Williams - How to Delegate Tasks? - Productive! Show

It's amazing to be talking to people from different parts of the globe and to see how we influence lives of people and teams all over the world and this time I talk to Glenn Williams from Australia. I published this interview originally on the [Nozbe blog][b] but I think it can be very interesting for you as well, as Glenn's experience helping companies get more done and adapt to change is very inspiring:
