# Building R2D2 Star Wars Lego robot which I got last Christmas

This past Christmas I got a very special [Lego](/lego) set which I won't reveal just yet, but last Christmas (in 2022) the Star Wars geek in me got a companion for my [baby Yoda](/yoda) - the **R2D2** droid. Here's the build process:

## Christmas tradition

[R2D2 Lego set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/r2-d2-75308) consists of 2314 bricks and is a cool replica of the [R2D2 Droid from Star Wars franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2). I announced my new build [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmmMPV_ImVX/) and got to work:

As you can see I set off with a very Christmas'y vibe: ginger bread and coffee. Good times.

## Middle leg - quite a tough thing to build

Here's the initial assembly of the main body and the leg in the middle of the droid:

Here's when the side legs are almost done and I think I'm doing great:

And this is the end product and all looks great, but doesn't work!

I had to disassemble the robot almost completely to figure out what didn't work and why the middle leg wouldn't come down properly. It took me quite a while to figure this one out:

## The R2D2 Body is ready!

Finally I sorted out the leg situation and managed to build the entire body of the robot. R2D2 is taking shape!

## Time for R2D2 spinning head!

That's the last part of the robot - the head that spins. I must say the last part of the droid was very satisfying to build:

## R2D2 done! Looking good!

Now the robot is done and it looks great next to its miniature version.

It was quite an experience. The set wasn't very easy to build but I must say I love having it in my [home office](/office/).
