# Hello, I'm Michael and I have 5 iPads...

We're about to publish the next episode of [The Podcast][tp] where we talk about the latest [Apple event](https://sliwinski.com/ipadpro) and we discuss the newest iPad Pro... And then Radek asks me about [my iPad][io]. And it's not like I have only one:

<!--More-->

Let's start in order of appearance:

**iPad 1 (64GB)** - yes we still use a 5-year old iPad. Actually my daughters use it for watching movies and playing games. It's still a great device for both of these purposes. 

**iPad mini 1 (16GB cellular)** I bought for testing iOS7 two years ago. It's running iOS9 today and I still keep it around for testing.

**iPad mini 2 (64GB cellular)** my wife's iPad of choice. Completely replaced her Kindle. She carries it in her purse and reads all her books on this. 

**iPad Air (64 GB cellular)** my previous iPad. I haven't sold it last year and kept it around as our "household" iPad. Also gaming device for my daughters (when games require the latest iOS). 

**iPad Air 2 (64GB cellular)** my ["only" iPad][io]. My main computer. This is where [I get my job done][n].

Optional:

**My wife's iPad Air 2** provided by her employer. She very often brings it home when she's teleworking. 

Soon:

**iPad Pro (128GB cellular)** - so I wrote my letter to Santa and this device made spot no 1. I'm totally buying this. Why? More in this weeks's episode of [The Podcast][tp]

***Question:*** *which iPad/iPads do you have?*
