# Lego Pixar Luxo Jr lamp with LED lights

Last Christmas I didn't know which kind of [LEGO set](/lego) to get myself and then when searching for a gift for my nephew in a toy store, I found this [Lego set #21357 with 613 pieces](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/disney-pixar-luxo-jr-21357){:target='_blank'} and I got it for myself. Then I searched up an LED set from [BrickBling](https://brickblingtoy.com/){:target='_blank'} and had a perfect Xmas gift 🎄🎁 - here's how I built it and [hooked it up to my home office automation](/nfc/):

## Step 1 - build Disney Pixar Luxo Jr lamp…

### It starts with the cute ball…

This cool lamp's build starts with a Pixar ball, full of Easter eggs of Pixar characters inside (explained in the attached video at the end of this post):

### Then comes the stand…

The lamp has this nice white stand:

### Followed by the arm…

These arms are very flexible:

### And finally the lamp gets a bulb…

…and is complete for now:

## Step 2 - add LED lights…

I got an older version of the [BrickBling](https://brickblingtoy.com/products/brickbling-light-kit-for-lego-ideas-%C7%80-disney-pixar-luxo-jr-21357-upgraded-switch-version) set that I'd recommend you get now. Oh well… it's still fine.

### Retrofit the bulb…

I've disassembled the bulb and glued the lights to two 1X1 LEGO flat blocks so that they stick nicely:

### Let's see if it works…

I've guided the wire through the lamp and connected everything and tada… my lamp was already showing light:

### Wiring was tricky…

I've added some of my own LEGO bricks to be able to wire the cable and attach it to the first part of the arm:

Later I've also used a similar technique to attach the cable to the lower part of the lamp arm:

And finally I've also redesigned a little the base of the lamp, so that the cable goes smoothly through it:

And the result is phenomenal - the wire is barely visible and everything looks like it was designed like this from the beginning:

## Step 3 - install the lamp and hook up to my smart home…

The last step was to find a place for the lamp and install the base of it with four small screws:

Later I connected the lamp's USB brick to a smart plug that's connected [to my smart home](/nfc) and now whenever I turn on my [camera in my recording studio](/studio) the lamp also turns on:

Which just looks great also in the background of my video footage whenever I'm on a Zoom call or [podcast recording](/noofficefm/):

I'm really enjoying my new [LEGO](/lego) lamp! What a great Christmas gift!
