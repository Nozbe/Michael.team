# Behind-the-scenes look of how we release Nozbe - Productive! Show #97

This episode is all about how we're doing software at Nozbe. I wanted to record this mostly for our users, showing you the complexity of our software as well as our commitment to regularly releasing a new and exciting version of our apps that is aligned with our vision. Plus a side note on version numbers :-) Question: Anything else you'd like to know about releasing software?
