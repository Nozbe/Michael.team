# McDonald's - my remote office of choice


Last week [I posted a detailed overview of my "Zen Home Office"](http://michaelnozbe.com/zen-in-my-new-2010-clutter-free-home-office) and I'm glad you liked it. I love working there, that's for sure. Yet, I'm not always there - I sometimes need to run errands, travel to a different city or just work outside of my home... and this may sound strange to you, but to work remotely I work at... McDonalds. Here's why:

## Free Wifi across Europe

When I lived in Warsaw (Poland) I thought it was just us... but this August I drove all the way to Spain from Poland and I traveled through Germany, Switzerland, France and Spain... and guess what? Every time I wanted to go online to check my email, I'd just go to the a McDonald's place on my way and I was sure when I pull out my laptop I'll be almost instantly online.

No charges, no extra signups, no extra hassle... it just works and it's free. This is what any road warrior needs - to know that in any city there is for 100% a place where the Internet will just work.

## Cappuccino - good coffee (in most of the locations)

I love coffee and surprisingly McDonald's doesn't offer bad coffee anymore. They now serve a true Arabica blend coffee and whenever I order a Cappuccino (or "Cafe con leche" in Spain) I'm almost sure I'll get a good coffee with my free Wifi. Sweet.

## Tasty salads so you don't get fat that fast

I've been visiting hundreds of McDonald's locations this year, yet I hardly remember when I had my last Big Mac... I just usually get a very fresh and tasty salad. They've improved and they are really good now. Believe me, I've been working hard to lose over 10 pounds the last 3 months so I know what I'm talking about.

## Newest technologies that make a geek like me feel at home

Believe it or not, but McDonald's restaurants are trying to roll out the newest technologies possible, especially when it comes to quick checkout. I love these things. I always try to sign up for the most modern and credit and debit cards (and they do accept Mastercard Paypass in Poland) and I like to try new things (and make the [Nozbe sigup experience](http://www.nozbe.com/signup) as painless as possible).

On the photo above you can see me paying for my Ceasar Grill Salad at McDonald's in Toulouse, France, where there was a big line to the cashier... I payed in 1 minute using my credit card at the automatic payment machine and picked my order from a special window in the next 3 minutes. I really like new technologies :-)

## It's not a Starbucks vs McDonald's debate

I love Starbucks, too, but in Europe we don't have so many of them and as far as I recall in the US you need special subscription to use the Internet there. There are lots of McDonald's restaurants in Europe (virtually in every city) and the arguments I listed above make McDonald's my perfect remote work office.
