# Google Plus - I ain't bothered


For the last couple of days the Internet is raving about yet another attempt from Google at the "social media" (after Wave and Buzz) called "Google+". People ask each others for invites to this new service... but I can't be bothered. I don't need another social network, do you?

## Nothing new

First of all, Google plus apparently is a verbatim copy of Facebook with some hyped "circles" features. What's an added benefit of this network? What is in it for me to switch to this new network apart from just having "yet another profile" on the web? And honestly, Google+ looks like Facebook+ - it's just copied Facebook with one more feature or two.

## Collecting friends all over again?

It's enough I have my friends on Facebook, connections on Linkedin, followers on Twitter, close friends on Foursquare... and you want me to start gathering friends on Google+?

Facebook is my social media platform, Linkedin is my professional network, Twitter is my audience, on Foursquare I have the closest friends I want to tell where I am (although, to be honest, I don't use it all that much and when I do, I post it on Twitter anyway)... and where does Google+ match this mix? It doesn't... because it wants to be my second Facebook.

## I haven't seen any compelling use case of Google+

I don't need another Facebook. One is enough. Google needs to find a real-use-case scenarios that will compel you all to go to this new platform. If you do, I'll follow. For now, I'm not convinced - but I'd like to know what's your take on that.

## How about an invite?

I don't want to be invited to Google+. From what I read (and I read many articles on this) it's just another Facebook, done by Google. Thank you but no thank you - just like my favorite British comedian Catherine Tate says - I ain't bothered - only she does it better than me:
