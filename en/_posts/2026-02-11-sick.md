# Are you working even when you're sick?

🤒 Sick in bed with your laptop 🧑‍💻 on your lap? Working through fever and flu? Working from home when sick? Should you, or should you not? 📅 Today, February 11 is World **Day of the Sick**. It feels like a good moment to talk about something uncomfortable about remote work.

## Should you work when sick?

> One real risk of working remotely is that people keep working even when they’re sick.

Because:

* “I’m at home anyway”
* “I’m not infecting anyone”
* “It’s just a cold”
* “I’ll just join the call, camera off”

But being sick is still being sick. Whether you’re in an office… or sitting at your kitchen table in pyjamas.

## If you're sick, don't work!

🧠 At Nozbe, we’ve been very clear about this for years:
**if you’re sick — don’t work.**

But because:

* working with a sick body also exhausts your mind
* it usually slows down recovery instead of speeding things up
* it creates a dangerous habit: treating health as secondary

And that always comes back. Sooner or later.

💡 How do we handle it in practice?

* if needed — **online doctor consultations**
* if you don’t want to see a doctor — **just rest**
* work can be **made up another day**: in the evening, over the weekend, or later in the week
* and sometimes… **it doesn’t need to be made up at all**

- The world won’t collapse.
- The project will wait.
- Your health might not.

🥶 Of course, if you've got just a little cold and you do want some work done, you can.

But remember:

🌱 Remote work is not about being “always available.”
It’s about having **more responsibility for yourself**.

👉 How does it work in your team — can people truly take time off when they’re sick?
