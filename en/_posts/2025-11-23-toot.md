# Shortcut to Post on Mastodon

I've been using [Mastodon][m] for more than 2 years now and this is my new place to hang out socially with other nerds as [I'm done with posting on Twitter/X](/twitter). As a heavy [Shortcuts](/shortcuts) user, based on a [Shortcut I found on the Internet][mo] I built my own one called ["🐘 Toot!"][s].

## Toot with text or image

On Mastodon some (including myself) are calling "posting to Mastodon" as "tooting", that's why:

### 🐘 [Get Toot Shortcut here for free][s]

You can either just use this Shortcut to toot a text message or you can share an image and point it to this Shortcut to toot an image with text. It works great either way.

I've added a limitation of 500 characters. This way if your text is too long, it'll prompt you to shorten it so that you can still toot your shorter message.

After your toot, the Shortcut copies the URL of your post to clipboard so you can later use it for something if you want.

## Setup questions

It will ask you for your mastodon server URL and your API key. The API key can be found if you go to `Preferences > Development > New Application` and you should enable two settings:

- `write:statuses`
- `write:media`

Once you've enabled that, copy and paste your API key to the Shortcut.

That's it. [Let me know if it works for you!][m]
