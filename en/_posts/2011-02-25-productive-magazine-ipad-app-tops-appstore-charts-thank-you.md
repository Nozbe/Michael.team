# Productive! Magazine iPad app tops Appstore charts! Thank you!


Wow, I suspected that releasing the [Productive! Magazine iPad app](http://ProductiveFirm.com/MagazineApp) for free would boost our readership but I never suspected that we'd get that far! Just checked our stats on the US Appstore and we're no. 15 on the Free iPad apps list in "Lifestyle" category - the most crowded magazine-specific category on the Appstore! Here you go:

**Help us get to Top 10! We're still not in the top ten, so please help us spread the word and help us climb up there!** Incredible, we're way ahead of such popular titles like "Martha's Stewart Living Magazine" (#16), "Project Magazine" (#31) or Glamour (#33). Did you ever suspect that a niche "productivity magazine", compiled by a bunch of productivity enthusiasts could compare and fight with these mainstream publications? Well, to quote US president Obama: "yes, we can!" :-)
