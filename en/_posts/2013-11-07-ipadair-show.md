# Unboxing the iPad Air and first impressions - Productive! Show #57


I'm on the roll with Productive Show recently, but this one can't wait. Just yesterday I presented the new Productive! Magazine iPad and iPhone app on my new iPad Air so today I simply needed to post my first unboxing video of my new Air. I'm testing accessories here, comparing it to my iPad4 and iPad Mini. Check it out. I really love my Air! And there is one thing I didn't expect... it's about the keyboard... check it out in the show!
