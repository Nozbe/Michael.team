# Why doing sports regularly is so great and so important... and how it makes me feel! - Productive! Show #74

This is probably the most personal episode of Productive! Show. I recorded it after having run 10 km and seeing a beautiful sunrise just afterwards. I did it mostly for myself - to have something to watch whenever I feel like quit doing sports. I hope you will find it encouraging and motivating as I do. Question: *Do you exercise regularly? Why? Why not?*
