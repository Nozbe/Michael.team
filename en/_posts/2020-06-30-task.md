## Task-based communication is all about getting things done... together!

Task-based communication introduces a simple structure:

> Projects -> Tasks -> Comments -> DONE

Basically:

- you group all your team goals in projects
- you specify tasks for each of these projects
- thanks to rich comments you gather all the data and feedback necessary to get stuff done.

You exchange information, feedback and opinions within tasks. You ask questions and get solutions right in tasks. You manage responsibilities within tasks. And then these tasks get done. Itâ€™s all structured, easy to follow and very actionable. Just watch the video and [let me know what you think!](/contact)
