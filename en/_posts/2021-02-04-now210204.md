# What's up as of February 4?

The first month of 2021 is over, the virus is still there but we're hoping that things will be looking up for us!

## Working on [Nozbe][n]

* I’m re-designing the way my team works - leading with context so that people get more autonomy!
* I’m writing a script for a new Nozbe Teams webinar and online course
* We’re celebrating [14 years of Nozbe](/nozbe14), soon with a promo and some other cool stuff.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* Completed my [annual review](/annual) and posted [my best blog posts of 2020](/2020best), my thorough [2020 annual review](/2020)
* Redesigned my home screens for the [iPad](/ipadscreen) and the [iPhone](/iphonescreen)
* Back to writing my [NoOffice book](/nooffice), already at 82% written!

## …and privately

* Started [Exodus 90](https://exodus90.com) with a few buddies of mine. More prayer, more reflection, more fitness, more fasting.
* Reset the counter for sports. Making sure I stay fit and I’m on track for my 50km swim, 500km run and 2000km bike milestones.
* Figuring out how to have an exciting family life when we’re basically confined in our home. One of these things was buildng a new Lego Porsche by myself (pictured above).
