# On February 4 '21 I am…

The first month of 2021 is over, the virus is still there but we're hoping that things will be looking up for us!

> Note: this is my monthly ["now page"](/now) update where I share with you what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]

* Re-designing the way my team works - leading with context so that people get more autonomy!
* Writing a script for a new Nozbe Teams webinar and online course
* Celebrating [14 years of Nozbe](/nozbe14), soon with a promo and some other cool stuff.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* Learning from last year - I posted [my best blog posts of 2020](/2020best) and a thorough [2020 annual review and summary](/2020)
* Working more efficienly with redesigned home screens for the [iPad](/ipadscreen) and  [iPhone](/iphonescreen)
* Back at writing [NoOffice book](/nooffice) - already at 82% written! I'm sharing my writing process on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/michaelsliwinski){:target='_blank'}

## …and privately

* Started [Exodus 90](https://exodus90.com) with a few buddies of mine. More prayer, more reflection, more fitness, more fasting.
* Reset the counter for sports. Making sure I stay fit and I’m on track for my 50km swim, 500km run and 2000km bike milestones.
* Figuring out how to have an exciting family life when we’re basically confined in our home. One of these things was buildng a new Lego Porsche (pictured above).
