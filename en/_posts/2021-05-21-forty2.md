# 42 and getting ready for a new reality

Yesterday I turned 42. I’m well in my [forties](/forty) [now](/forty1). Hopefully no mid-life crisis on the horizon. But I’m looking at the post-pandemic world and the new reality and I’m starting to adjust to it. I just got [my first COVID-19 vaccine shot](/vaccine) which is a great first step. Now I need to grow much more as a [Nozbe][n] CEO and [NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) author. Much more.

## New kind of CEO

Even though I'm 42 now, I still don't think I've grown up enough to be a CEO my company deserves. There's a lot to learn. A lot to embrace.

I just started a coaching program. I'm in the middle of company restructuring and I'm re-shaping my role as the CEO and leader of this team. Lots to learn.

I want to be as smart as [my guru Michael Hyatt](https://nozbe.com/blog/nooffice-20-work-life-balance-by-michael-hyatt/) when I grow up. It was so much fun celebrating my birthday with him yesterday!

## New kind of Nozbe

We've got two apps, [Nozbe Personal][np] and [Nozbe Teams][n] now and in the coming months we need to figure out a way to communicate this to our prospective customers. Now we very often get them confused and they don't know which app is for them. Time to set the record straight.

I feel like we've overslept this pandemic time. As a company we've been ready for this. We've been working [without an office](/nooffice) for a long time and we should be leading the way, but we're not. Not yet at least.

## New kind of book!

Time to finish it off! I'm almost done with the [#NoOffice book](https://nooffice.org) but I'm really procrastinating finishing it. I'm not sure why. I need to beat this and get my act together. And re-connect with my true "why".

I'm right before the finish line and it feels I'm sabotaging my goal. And the world needs my book! I see that they do.

## Time to grow up!

Yes, I'm 42 and feels I have lots of growing up to do. If you're reading this, thanks for being around and cheering me on. Please don't stop, [send me kudos on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSliwinski) or [on Instagram](https://instragram.com/michaelsliwinski).

I'm 42 and I feel like I'm barely getting started. Let's go!
