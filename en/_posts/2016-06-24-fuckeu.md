# Brexit EU anthem… by John Oliver

Yesterday was the [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) vote that as we know now (*I'm posting this on Feb 24,2026 - almost 10 years later*) caused the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 to leave the European Union 🇪🇺. To remember this stupid move by my British friends to basically unfriend us - the EU citizens from the continent, I've decided to post [John Oliver's Brexit episode that ends with a "Brexit" Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgKHSNqxa8).

## Lyrics of the "Brexit Song"

Feel free to sing along:

> Fuck you European Union,\\
> Tally-ho, you fucking pricks!\\
> We are the United Kingdom,\\
> You can eat are spotted dicks!

> That being said we're not going to leave you\\
> Turns out we need you! Nonetheless\\
> Fuck you, European Union!\\
> It feels good to tell you this!

> Poland is depressing\\
> And there's vampires in Romania\\
> Spain is far too hot\\
> And where the fuck is Lithuania?

> To be fair, Slovenia's lovely\\
> (We're only kidding, it sucks too!)\\
> But we must admit without these countries\\
> We'd be really screwed!

> Fuck the European Union\\
> Even though we must admit\\
> We would all be batshit crazy\\
> If we vote for leaving it!

Well yes, they were batshit crazy, unfortunately:
