# The Podcast #209 - Lean house

We’re back recording [The Podcast!](/podcast) after more than half a year of silence! And we geek out. Actually, Radek does as he explains how he’s managing his groceries (the same way the Japanese factories are doing lean manufacturing!). Let’s hope we’ll be recording more episodes in 2021 - please let us know if you want us back for good!
