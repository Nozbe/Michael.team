# LEGO - how I’m unleashing a child within me by building a new lego set every year (just for me!)

I’m a big fan of LEGO bricks. I’ve had them when I was a child (my favorite were the “Pirate” pieces) and now that I’m a grown man... I still love building Legos. And even though I have 3 baby girls and my eldest loves LEGO, too - I'm not only building LEGO with them, I’ve recently started getting LEGO sets just for me. And this year is no different - here’s my latest LEGO set that I’m about to assemble just now - [James Bond's Aston Martin DB5](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/james-bond-aston-martin-db5-10262) made out of **1295** pieces:

## This year I'm Bond, James Bond...

And I'm building the historic [Aston Martin DB5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5). What a car. What an icon!

## Last year I was a Bugatti Chiron driver and three years before that I was rocking a Porsche GT3 RS.

Last year for Christmas I got this amazing [Bugatti Chiron set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bugatti-chiron-42083) - a replica of a [real car by the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron). It took me more than 3 months to assemble it...

For 2016 Xmas I got an epic [Porsche GT3 RS set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/porsche-911-gt3-rs-42056) - a very cool replica of the [real deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_GT3). This one took only two months to get built...

Both cars are in my home office now:

## I always take my time building LEGO - it's a social event... and a reason to spend time with friends... and play!

One of the key features of an [essentialist](/essentialist) by [Greg McKeown in Essentialism](/essentialism) is to have time to play. This is what LEGO does for me.

I love playing with LEGO and building it.

[We've talked about it on The Podcast](/podcast-8/).

I love taking my time building a big LEGO set, enjoying assembling it with my friends, talking about it, discussing it... and jut uncovering a child within me.

I wish the same for you - Happy Christmas!

And I'll get back to my James Bond car...
