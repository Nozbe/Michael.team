# The Podcast #138 - Leap of faith

This week our semi-annual [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion) starts so I’d like to post here [The Podcast][p] episode from two weeks ago where we discussed serious topics of taking the blame, brokenness of companies... these kinds of subjects we also tend to discuss here when we meet in-person with my team. Enjoy!
