# Interview with Marten Mickos for the Productive! Magazine #15 - Productive! Show #59


On the special occasion of re-launching and re-designing the Productive! Magazine - and after almost a year, publishing a new issue - #15, I interviewed Mårten Mickos, the former CEO of MySQL and the present CEO of Eucalyptus Systems. Mårten is my guru in terms of distributed team management. In 2008 he led a team of 500 people, 70% of whom worked remotely in 110 major locations in 32 countries and across 18 time zones. The video chat you are about to watch was a great inspiration to me. If you wish to learn more about Mårten's approach to running a business and managing the biggest teleworking company in the world check out the latest (15th) issue of Producitve! Magazine.
