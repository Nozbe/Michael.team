# Guest @Context with Tara Rodden Robinson and Augusto Pinaud

It was a great interview with Tara and Augusto. It was actually the first time I spoke to either of them. For me and Augusto it was a start of a long friendship. The episode is no longer online but trust me it was a great discussion between three hardcore [GTD productivity](/productivity) enthusiasts. [More info ℹ️][l]

Getting this episode together was a long time coming. I got an invite in August 2009:

…and we recorded this show in October (this is the first time me and Augusto talked), when we also recorded the [GTD Virtual Study Group show](/gtdvsg):

…only to have it published next year [in February][l].
