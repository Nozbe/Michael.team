# Skiing and thinking long term…

How has my long term thinking impacted my attitude towards skiing? Yes, seriously, there’s a connection and a good one!

## I’m an avid skier ⛷️ 

I learned to ski when I was a little over 10 years old and I’ve been skiing almost every year all my life. I love the speed, the wind, the snow, the freedom, the exhaustion at the end of a great day in the mountains…

Skiing holiday of at least a week was a must for me every year. I was looking forward to it each winter…

However, now I have a wife, who's not such an avid skier and three daughters who are beginners…

## Should I be selfish and ski on my own… or?… think long term?

Initially I stopped going skiing.

Later I convinced my family to go on a short 3 day trip to ski. I hired them instructors for a few hours a day and spent time with them patiently skiing only until they said they didn't want to do it anymore.

I wanted to ski more, but I didn't, because I was thinking long term - I was investing my time and my patience, hoping they'd like the sport and want to ski a little more each year.

And each year we did a little longer skiing holidays.

This year we're on our second straight week-long skiing holidays and all of my girls (both daughters and wife) enjoy the sport and we get to ski together.

And it's fun.

Today as I was going downhill with my daughters, seeing them how much they enjoy it and how happy they are skiing with me, I know it paid off.

Instead of going on solo ski trips, I get to spend them with my family and share my beloved sport with them!

## Stats in the last few years…

Update after the week. Look at the stats. i went skiing alone in 2019 for 2 days and in the beginning of 2020 (right before the pandemic) and later nothing… and then with family:

* 2023: only 23 km as I was mostly teaching my daughters to ski.
* 2024: doubled at 46 km as we were doing some longer rides. Still lots of teaching.
* 2025: doubled that at 82 km as we went for a proper 4-day ski trip and girls were even better.
* 2026: a whopping 130km in 5 days of skiing where not only they were even better but they wanted to ski more and do it with their daddy 😍
