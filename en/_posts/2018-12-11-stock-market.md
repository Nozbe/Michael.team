# Stock market doesn’t make any sense to me as Microsoft is more valuable than Apple...

This has been an interesting year. Apple was the first company to break the 1 trillion dollar valuation at one point... but now as they’ve plateaued with iPhone unit sales and announced that they will no longer be publishing the quantity of headsets sold... their stock literally plummeted from above $220 to $169 today and the best part is that now Microsoft is worth more than Apple. Why? Well... I honestly don’t get it...

## I’ll never understand the stock market...

Let’s start with a disclaimer: I own quite a few units of Apple stock and I use Apple devices daily, so I’m obviously emotionally involved here.

Here’t the proof: I just bought the new [iPhone XS](https://sliwinski.com/newdevice), the [new iPad Pro 11”](https://sliwinski.com/ipadretro) and the [new Apple Watch series 4](https://sliwinski.com/watch4)... so their products obviously don’t suck...

Yet there’s a question of growth... Apple, apparently is doomed as they’re not going to sell as many iPhones as they should be, right?

## Microsoft more valuable than Apple? Are you kidding me?

When I heard about it (and this situation stands today as you can see from the screenshot above), [I tweeted this](https://twitter.com/MSliwinski/status/1069007612555997184):

> … and with that we’ve decided to drop all iOS and Mac related projects at @[Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) and focus entirely on the world’s dominant mobile platform:
> Windows Phone!
> …. oh wait… 🤔

Exactly! Microsoft is losing on so many fronts - it lost the mobile war (there is no Windows Phone anymore), they’re struggling with tablets (with Surface products) and they’re dependent on Intel - who’s struggling making processors these days. They’re just milking the cow thanks to Microsoft Office 365 platform... which I honestly don’t use anymore...

Whereas Apple’s iPhone is one of the two dominant mobile platforms, they’re kicking Intel’s ass with ARM-based A-series chips and soon [they’ll be releasing Macs with these processors](https://sliwinski.com/thepodcast-154), they’ve got the [dominant tablet with the iPad](/tag/ipadonly) and the dominant fitness tracker [with the Apple Watch](/tag/applewatch/)... and their recurring services revenue is soaring.

Where’s the logic here? What gives?

## Luckily [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com) is not on a stock exchange and won’t be!

I really don’t get the stock market. I won’t be buying any more stock, I’ll just keep the Apple Stock I have and that’s it.

I don’t think I’d ever want to run a public company.

Even if Nozbe is 100 times more successful than now I’ll keep Nozbe private because answering to the investors who apparently are driven by some strange kind of sentiment doesn’t sound like lots of fun. And doesn’t bring value to the actual users!

Anyway. There’s no conclusion here. I’m just really confused about all this.

## “You have to understand, that the financial markets are driven by sentiment”...

It’s like in this sketch about the financial crisis - which still holds up pretty well:
