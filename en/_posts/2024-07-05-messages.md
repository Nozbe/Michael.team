## With Messages Nozbe becomes your team’s action and communication super app!

Here’s how we described it on the [Nozbe blog][l]:

> Nozbe is a productivity app and its simple interface of projects, tasks and comments that works across all your devices, is very action-focused. We didn’t want to introduce additional distractions or promote spending time on chatting instead of getting the actual work. We realized, though, how cool it could be to have all of your team communication in one place. On any device. And so we figured out how to introduce Messages the Nozbe way.
