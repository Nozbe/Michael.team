# Blog, link-blog... or both - my new blogging test

When I moved my blog from old "MichaelNozbe.com" domain to this one, I decided to actually create two blogs - this one... and a [Link-blog][lb] at [Links.MichaelSliwinski.com][lb] in order to be able o post links to the things that might interest you on my own platform instead of using apps like "Buffer" or "Tumblr". After three months of this experiment I feel like experimenting even more :-)

**I'm a big fan of [John Gruber][jg], [Marco Arment][ma] and [MG Siegler][mg]... as well as [Michael Hyatt][mh], [Fred Wilson][fw] and [Seth Godin][sg]**

The first three guys run very successful link-blogs - I usually read their blogs more for their comments and opinions than for the links they post to. Yes, I do click on the links very often or add them to my "Read-it-later" app but their comment is what counts. I like it and I'm tempted to try the same... On the other hand the other three guys run very successful blogs with original content and I want to be able to post as frequently and as thoughtful as they do... what to do then?



**You seem to like my link-blog, too**

Over the last three months I posted many links on my [link-blog][lb] and a few original posts on this blog. What I found out was that although you appreciated my posts a lot, you actually engaged more with my link-blog posts - I received more likes, retweets and questions about my link-blog posts - you appreciated things I was linking to and my comment (I hope :-)

Anyway, I like doing both - I like posting links to interesting sites and adding my comment... and I like writing original blog posts. That's why I decided to stop posting on the link-blog and start posting links on this very blog. That's right - for the next 30 days this blog will be a mix of a typical blog and a link-blog - and you tell me what you think about it.

**Following the Gruber's path**

John Gruber on his famous blog: ["Daring Fireball"][jg] posts mainly links but sometimes posts original content. He distinguishes the original content with an asterisk.

I'll do something similar - my original blog posts will have a "tick" (&#10004;) sign next to the blog post title and usually will be a little longer. And usually with an original graphic (drawn by yours truly in Paper app on the iPad)

**Posting Frequency**

I'll try to commit to writing at least three original blog posts a week (never more than one per day) - with a tentative schedule like this:

* on a Monday (like today) - original blog post about productivity, business and/or life
* on a Wednesday - book of the week (my book review) or Productive! Show episode
* on a Friday - original blog post about [iPadonly][ipad], Passion or Teleworking - (as I'm writing books on these topics)
* any day else - when I feel like writing more, I will - I reserve myself the right to do so :-)

I'll try to post around 4-6 links per day - around every 4 hours or so - I think this frequency strikes a balance between posting quite often but not too often to get you tired. Again, I'll post a link with a short paragraph with my comment or opinion.

At the end of each month I'll post links to all of the original blog posts to make sure you haven't missed anything.

*Questions: **How often do you post on your blog? How often do you want me to? Which topics do you want me to link to? Have you [subscribed to my blog][is] or my [Facebook page][fb]?***
