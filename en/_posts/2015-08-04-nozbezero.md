# How clarity and essentialism helped me get to NozbeZero. No more tasks for today.

It's been a long time coming. Recently I mentioned a book I've been studying: [Essentialism - the disciplined pursuit of less](https://sliwinski.com/essentialism). This was a real eye opener for me. I shifted my focus back to the basics. Back to what I'm all about. Back to [productivity](/productivity). Back to [Nozbe][]. I'll write more about it soon, but the result yesterday was awesome. At the end of the day, I had no tasks to do:

I've divided my week into themes:

* Monday is for weekly review and CEO stuff 
* Tuesday is for marketing
* Wednesday is for product
* Thursday is for writing [my book](https://sliwinski.com/noofficebook) and marketing content
* Friday is for meetings

Yesterday when doing my [Weekly review](https://sliwinski.com/prodchat-weekly-review) I removed lots of projects. Completed things in my backlog, and focused my week around these weekly themes. I moved marketing tasks to the other days. Prioritized things.

This felt great. And while today I didn't manage to complete all of my marketing tasks, I'm hopeful to have more #NozbeZero days in the future. Here's to essentialism! Here's to focused productivity!

***Question:*** *when was the last time you had a #NozbeZero day?*
