## ⏳ Start Getting Ready Early

Start thinking about your vacation a few weeks in advance – take on less work, avoid last-minute scrambling, and consider speeding things up a bit.

## 📣 Give Everyone a Heads-Up

Let your coworkers and clients know when you’ll be out. Add your vacation dates to your email signature so everyone’s in the loop and can plan ahead.

## 4️⃣ What to Do 4 Weeks Before Vacation

1. Take on fewer tasks.  
2. Let your coworkers and clients know your dates.  
3. Start setting priorities – what *has* to be handled before your break.

## 2️⃣ Tasks for 2 Weeks Before Vacation

Review all your tasks and projects and clarify what needs to be done before you leave. Decide who will take care of anything that needs to move forward while you’re away.

## 🚀 Go Into Turbo Mode

Put in some extra effort now to save yourself stress later. Don’t be afraid to say no to new tasks or requests at this point.

## 1️⃣ One Week Before Vacation

CC your backup in important emails or mention them in tasks in Nozbe/your task manager. Make it clear it’s the final call: *“I’ll be out from ... Please send anything urgent by the end of this week.”*

## 💡 One Day Before Vacation

* Set a clear out-of-office message  
* Let people know how to reach you in a true emergency + define it 🆘  
* Tidy up both your physical and digital workspaces  
* Turn off work-related email, calendar, and app notifications on your phone
