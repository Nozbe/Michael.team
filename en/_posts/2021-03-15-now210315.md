> Note: this is my monthly ["now page"](/now) update where I share with you what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* I’m preparing for April webinar on team productivity
* Nozbe Teams web site is getting better, just launched a new [pricing page - TeamIsFree.com](https://nozbe.com/free) with a special video explainig the "why" behind our pricing (embedded below)
* We’re about to launch a big [Nozbe Teams][n] feature - *joint projects* - which will be a game changer!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m finishing off [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org/) - I’m at 90%+ in English and the Polish and Spanish translations are at 80%+ as well!
* I’ve migrated [The Podcast . FM](/podcast) to this site to simplify our podcasting setup
* I’m working on this site more to simplify it. I might start blogging also at [Hey World](https://world.hey.com/michaels/)

## …and privately:

* I’ve lost some weight (I’m back at 70kg), so my diet is working!
* I’m back at playing [tennis](/tennis) which brings me joy
* I’m still missing travels… so with my family we’re traveling locally…
