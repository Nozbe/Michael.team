## ‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è Batching tasks prevents multitasking

It reduces task-switching costs - the mental effort needed to switch between different activities. No more writing a report, making a phone call, and checking emails‚Ä¶ instead you group all phone calls and emails together!

## üåä Batching helps you enter flow state

Flow is easier to achieve when you‚Äôre doing the same type of task repeatedly, rather than constantly switching between different types of work. You're in a flow‚Ä¶ or groove üï∫

## ü™´ Batching also conserves mental energy ‚ö°Ô∏è

You reduce decision fatigue - the mental exhaustion that comes from constantly deciding what to work on next. You can block time to handle all your calls or emails in one go!

## üè∑Ô∏è Tags in Nozbe help group and batch and more!

It's a more flexible and intuitive way to group and categorize tasks. Tags in Nozbe are dynamic, allowing you to add attributes that make sense for your work and life: based on tools, locations, projects, or even urgency!üî•

## üôã Tags are optional but helpful!

The traditional structure of projects > tasks > comments is great but thanks to tags you can group tasks across various projects by tool, location, person or mental state ‚Äî so you can work more efficiently.
