# Semi Professional Canon EOS 100D DSLR review for a guy like me - Productive! Show #92


Today I have a pretty thorough gadget review and unboxing experience of Canon EOS 100D also known as Rebel 1 - a perfect semi-professional camera for an amateur photographer, video-maker and a father who just wants to shoot better pictures of their children. I've done this unboxing a few months back and I've used this camera since on a number of occasions and it's brilliant. Totally recommend it! Also I talk about the accessories I bought with the camera - which, why, and how much it all costs. Enjoy and if you've got some pro advice for me - let me know in the comments - I've only started with this!
