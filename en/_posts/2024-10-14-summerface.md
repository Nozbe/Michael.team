# Apple Watch face for the Summer and weekends

As I keep using the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra) and [keep loving it](/iphone15ultra) I keep tweaking the watch faces. I've already blogged about **[World Clock Watch Face](/worldclock)** and now it's time for my Summer/weekend watch face, again based on the *Ultra Modular*.

## Ultra Modular with BIG clock and 6 complications

I really like the HUGE clock in the Ultra Modular watch face. It reminds me of old Casio watches and it's truly digital.

Above the clock I have 3 complications:

- **Weather** - to quickly glance at local temperature and access the weather app
- **Camera app** - to remotely control the camera on the [iPhone](/iphone15) - especially great for group photos or selfies
- **Fitness rings** - to motivate me to move during the day

Below the clock there are 3 additional complications:

- **Calendar** - to be able to quickly launch calendar and see what day is today at a glance
- **Elevation** - as I hike or visit different places I like to be able to see how high I am above the sea level
- **Timer** - to be able to set a timer quickly for cooking or whatever and to see its progress right on the watch face

## Swiping between watch faces is where it's at!

As I mentioned, I have several watch faces that I change depending on the day. I have [World Clock](/worldclock) watch face and other watch faces for work (which I'll soon blog about). The cool thing is that Apple brought us back the way to [swipe between them](/watchfaces) - just go to **Settings > Clock > Swipe to Switch Watch Face**

I really hope that at some point Apple will let us have custom watch faces on the Apple Watch. Until then I just customize my watch by using the Modular Ultra watch face with different complications.
