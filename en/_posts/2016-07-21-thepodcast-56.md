The changes are coming very soon here to this blog. I really want to provide you, my reader with much more value here and I want to basically co-write my next year's book, [NoOffice](https://sliwinski.com/nooffice) with you by blogging concepts of the book here and getting your feedback. 

And I'm going to actually provide you with even more value when we [connect via email](https://sliwinski.com/passion).
