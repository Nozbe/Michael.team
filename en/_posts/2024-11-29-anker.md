# Anker chargers worth buying in 2024

Now that I've posted a comprehensive list of things [I carry in my backpack](/backpack) and it's still **Black Week** on Amazon and in many other places, let's talk about chargers. Here in Europe there are 3 chargers from Anker worth considering: Prime 100W, 67W and 47W and despite their clear differences in power, in size they are quite similar:

## Anker 523 47W - lightest, cheapest and best all-around charger

This white (there's also a black option) charger is my favorite one to give to my family members. Two USB-C ports with enough juice to charge an [iPhone](/iphone), [iPad](/ipadonly) or [Apple Watch](/applewatch).

It's dirt cheap at a regular price of around 19 EUR and now at Black Friday it's at 15-16 EUR in [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain](https://amzn.to/4fUe4Wz) or [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany](https://amzn.to/3CMJuiZ).

In [ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland](https://amzn.to/4gbiLuK) it's only 90 PLN. In the [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA](https://amzn.to/49h90cf) today it's at $24.

At these prices it just doesn't make any sense to buy any other USB-C charger. This one is fast, compact and has two ports.

And it's only 90 grams!

## Anker Prime 67W - most compact and best value for 3 ports

If you want a more powerful and capable charger, with an additional USB-A port, this one is just great. It's ultra compact. It's basically the same dimensions as the previous one, only, it's beefier and heavier at 160 grams, but even the European version folds the power sticks, which makes it really compact.

This one can be easily used to charge not only your mobile devices but also most of the laptops. I gave it to my wife so she can have a compact charger for her Windows laptop. However, as you can see below, it's more than double the price of the Nano 47W.

Normally priced at 60 EUR at Black Friday it's only 32 EUR in [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain](https://amzn.to/4g66esA) or 40 in [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany](https://amzn.to/4ippovJ).

In [ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland](https://amzn.to/4ga88IU) it's 180 PLN today. In the [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA](https://amzn.to/3OrUeWG) it's at full price - $60.

## Anker Prime 100W - the most powerful and still small!

If you do need the occasional 100W charge or you want to be able to charge a [laptop](/laptop) and some other devices at the same time, this one is just 20 grams heavier and only a little bigger than the 67W. I only wish it had 4 ports instead of 3.

Normally priced at 80-90 EUR at Black Friday it's only 43 EUR in [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain](https://amzn.to/3Bc8pMk) or 64 in [ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany](https://amzn.to/3B7CJb1).

In [ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland](https://amzn.to/3CLEg7g) it's 280 PLN today. In the [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA](https://amzn.to/3CPRMqq) it's at $55 (so 5 bucks cheaper than the 67W version!).

## Which one to get?

All are very similar in size, but difference in price and weight and depending on which devices you're planning to charge, it's up to you. All I'm saying is that I've bought several of those 47W chargers and have steadily replaced old crappy chargers in my house and in my [backpacks](/backpack).
