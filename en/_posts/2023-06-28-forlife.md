## Lifetime productivity guarantee for Nozbe

The Internet is constantly changing. Many Internet services come and go and it's hard to rely on them when even the biggest players such as [Google seem to be killing off](https://killedbygoogle.com) their services as fast as they make new ones.

Contrary to most Internet companies, we're not profit-driven. [Nozbe is a mission-driven company](/nozbe-why/) and our mission is:

> To help busy professionals (and their team members) manage their work and life in an simple way.

Our [Nozbe][n] users depend on our products and we take this commitment very seriously. [Nozbe sp. z o.o.](/llc/) is a small and independent company without outside investors and we solely answer to our users. We want them to keep achieving their work-life balance every single day using Nozbe.

## Nozbe Personal - helping close to 1 million users since 2007

Our first product - [Nozbe Personal][np] - has been around for years and we're committed to **keeping it online indefinitely**. We still have many thousands upon thousands of paying and free users depending on it every single day and we're determined to keep serving them.

## Nozbe (formerly "Nozbe Teams") - new productivity app launched in 2020

We launched our second iteration of [Nozbe][n] as a completely separate product as we wanted to have a clean slate in terms of technology and design.

New Nozbe is the natural successor to Nozbe Personal and is [constantly being updated](https://nozbe.help/general/release-notes/) with new features and improvements.

[We offer our users ways to migrate][nm] from Nozbe Personal to the new Nozbe but are not forcing them to do so. We leave the decision to our users' preferences.

## FAQ of "trusted system for life"

### 1. What if the status of the Nozbe - the company - changes?

While we can guarantee commitment to serving our customers, we can't really predict what the future brings. In case of unlikely IPO, sale of the company or other changes in company ownership, we will make sure to focus on serving our customers first. This means we will provide a long-term plan to make sure that Nozbe products can be relied on for as long as possible. If there comes a necessity to migrate data we will give plenty of notice and make it easy for our users and assist them in any way we can.

### 2. What if some technologies become unavailable or old?

Nozbe products are built mainly using web technologies and as all of these are open-source and widely available, we are confident we can keep these products running on our servers indefinitely. This way we can guarantee to keep giving access to our products through both desktop- and mobile-based web browsers.

Should some app vendors like Google (Android) or Apple terminate any kind of technologies that current Nozbe products depend on, we'll do our best to find replacements to keep our apps going.

### 3. What if you get bored and become uninterested in running Nozbe?

I think our track record speaks for itself. After 16 years (in 2023, and counting!) of running [Nozbe][n] I still feel like I'm just getting started so I'm all excited to be serving our Nozbe users for many years to come.

Again, in an unlikely scenario of me being ready to move on or any other significant change in the future, I guarantee figuring out a long-term plan for Nozbe users will be the most important thing to do.

**Again, we are a mission-driven company.** Not profit-driven. While profits are nice, we are here to serve our customers first and boy do we enjoy doing that!

### [Nozbe][n] is your trusted system for life.
