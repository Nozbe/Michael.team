# Switching to monthly cadence for No Office podcasts

I love podcasting 🎧 and I'm an avid podcast listener and producer. Even though I'm busy developing my app [Nozbe][n], I love sharing tips and tricks for our clients on [the "No Office" podcast](/noofficefm). This year, based on the amount of work we have on the app, I've decided to lower the frequency of the podcast to just once a month, but I want to make it count!

## 🤖 Nozbe.ai or AI in Nozbe?

I just recorded an episode on AI at Nozbe where we shared our tips and tricks on using AI for [productivity](/productivity) and how we've been slowly but surely developing our AI skills over the last year. This time I was recording solo but I hoped it went great. BTW, the presentation I shared on this recording was done by AI as well! (Based on 1.5K words of copious notes I prepared 😱).

## Podcast cadence changed to once a month!

This year we've got exciting new features planned for our customers so I'm going to be very busy with product development.

Also, we are shifting our marketing activities kind of drastically into a new direction, as indicated by my mentor, Nathan Barry. This will keep me totally locked in.

## Podcast is still a great long term investment

I was advised to completely drop the podcast but I know many of our customers listen to it. And some episodes, like one of the previous ones on using Nozbe as CRM, have resonated with many of our customers.

So, here's to 12 great episodes of the "[No Office](/noofficefm)" and "[Nie Ma Biura](/pl/niemabiura/)" (the Polish edition) podcasts this year!

P.S. I'll still be recording [Nadgryzieni podcast](/pl/nadgryzieni) on Fridays as this more of a hobby for me than work :-) It's a "[Mighty Friday](https://nozbe.com/friday/?c=michaelteam)" thing…
