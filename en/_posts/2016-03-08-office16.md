# My Home Office 2016: whiteboard, stand-up desk, chill-out sofa and less stuff

[Every year][o] I'm changing something at [Nozbe][n] headquarters, aka [my home office][o] and tonight after work I decided to change a few things as well. Here's how my 2016 home office looks like with highlights:

## Whiteboard front and center

[I've already sang praises to it, but really, whiteboard](/whiteboard) is my favorite tool for planning and brainstorming. Lately I've been doing a lot of that so I've moved it a little more to the center of my wall to make sure I can take advantage of every inch of it. 

## Stand up desk still rocks

I've been standing a lot recently while working and I enjoy it more than sitting actually. And when I do want to sit I just lower the desk and use the pilates ball as my chair or...

## Chill out sofa is there!

Haven't had that in a few years in my home office so I decided to bring it back. Makes the space more "cozy" and will be useful for reading or sketching on my iPad.

## Less stuff and clutter...

As always when I modify my home office I always end up questioning lots of things there and getting rid of clutter that always piles up. My environment here is now cleaner and nicer!

## That's just my home office...

In my company [everyone works from home](/teleworking) and if you're curious how other people on my team work, feel free to [check out our home offices][oo] as well as our [Nozbe customers offices][oc]. Hope these set ups will inspire you to improve your workspace just like they help me [improve mine every year.][o]
