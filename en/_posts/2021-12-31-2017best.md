# Essentialism, productivity webinars, podcasting on life and books and much more - best of 2017

As I imported 2017 blog posts from my old site **sliwinski.com** to here I noticed quite a few gems worth getting back to. It turns out I spent 2017 [podcasting](/podcast/) regularly, producing [webinars](/webinars/) and reviewing [books](/books), too. And much more. Here are my best entries from that year:

## Year of webinars

I prepared many high-quality [webinars](/webinars/) in 2017, covering topics like [doing a good Weekly Review](/perfect-weekly-review/), [finishing off the year with focus](/backtowork/), [planning holidays effectively](/planning-holidays/), [maximizing team productivity](/max-team-productivity/), or [getting everything done in 10 simple steps](/10-steps-productivity/) and [getting New Years Resolutions done](/resolutions). Each webinar is an hour-long presentation, carefully researched and well prepared so well worth your time!

## A decade of [Nozbe][n]

In 2017 I celebrated [10 years of running Nozbe](/nozbe10/) and I even produced [a very cool webinar about that](/10-years-of-nozbe/) and a [special the Podcast episode](/podcast-83/). I explained how we [organized a successful reunion](/reunion/) and we recorded two in-person podcasts on our reunions: [one in Toruń](/podcast-91/) and [one in Wrocław](/podcast-116/). What an achievement and privilege of being able to be a decade-long-entrepreneur!

## Simplicity and Essentialism were a theme of 2017

I produced [the last issue #34](/productivemag/) of the [Productive! Magazine](/magazine/) featuring an [interview with Greg McKeown](/greg-mckeown/), the author of [Essentialism - the pursuit of less but better](/essentialism/). I also posted [highlights from this book](/esssentialist/) and we [talked about the book on the Podcast](/podcast-112/).

In this spirit, I talked about [simplicity](/podcast-107/), the books: [Insanely Simple](/podcast-94/), [Peak](/peak/), [Marie Kondo method](/kondo/), [Stoicism](/podcast-103/).

Thanks to all that wisdom I established my **[2-hour rule](/2hours/)** and new [review routines](/review/).

This also translated to my [iPad](/ipadonly/) with posts on [setting up new iPad from scratch](/newipad/) and a thorough [list of all my iPad apps](/ipadapps/). I also shared my [#iPadOnly recording set](/recording/) and why I love [wireless headphones](/headphones/).

BTW, in 2017 I was rocking [an iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black](/iphone7plus-jetblack/) and [an iPad Pro 10.5"](/ipadwork/).

## 2017 was 5 years ago!

Today is the last day of 2021 and the new, 2022 starts tomorrow. The posts I just reviewed happened 5 years ago but they still stand. I will be celebrating 15 years of [Nozbe][n] in just a month. A decade and a half. Time flies.
