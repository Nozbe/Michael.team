## Magazine is free (I only ask for an email address)

Magazine will always be free. I do it because I love doing it and I love getting to know new people in my "productivity industry" and for this issue I received many great new contributions and connected with some amazing folks.

The only change I did this time is that from now on, to download the latest issue I do ask you to sign up for our Newsletter. This ensures that I can email you about new issues and stay in touch. I decided it's time to build a great "productivity community" and this is how I'm getting started.
