# Stretch goals - how do you set them and get them done?

I'm in the middle of planning our new marketing strategy for [Nozbe][n] for the end of this year and the entire 2016. I need to make this actionable and ambitious and I have a few goals in mind in terms of revenue, customer growth and cutomer happiness. The problem is, there are all stretch goals:

The problem is that if you put **too big of a goal** you might get discouraged (like I am a little now) that you're on a track to not making it. 

However, a big goal might motivate you to **think outside of the box** to get your goal done.

That's why I'm at crossroads now. I really want to find a way to achieving my stretch goals, even though I'm afraid they won't be reachable. And when I don't reach them, I'll think of myself like a failure.

And I want to feel like a winner. 

***Question:*** *how do you get your goals done?*
