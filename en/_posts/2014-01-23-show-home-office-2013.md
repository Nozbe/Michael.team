# My Home office 2013 - Productive!Show #62

It's already 2014 so this video is long overdue especially that I'm planing to make some changes to my home office this year but the principles stay the same and I think you'll get a great dose of inspiration from this one. I really like to have my working space neatly done and well organized and I think you can see that in my video. It's basically a sit-down desk for my traditional computer and a stand-up desk for my iPad and little else. Hope you like it! Question: *How do you organize and design your work environment?*
