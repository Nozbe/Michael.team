# On September 26 `25 I am…

…finishing up September and getting seriously ready for the last quarter of this year to make sure I reach my goals for this year!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* I’m getting ready for next week’s [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion) in Bydgoszcz - reviewing plans, preparing my keynote speech and more!
* We’ve started working on cycle 40 of our development for the app and some cool new features are coming - redesigned Sidebar, Print support and sharing a task with a link!
* We are planning our sales push for the next quarter, which includes stepping out of our comfort zone - exciting!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’ve updated my [Weekly Calendar](/week) and I’m determined to be working within [core hours](/podcast-204) much more!
* I’m waiting for my new shiny iPhone Air to arrive and AirPods 3 Pro - later this week! I’ve already switched from normal SIM to eSIM in my [iPhone 15 Pro](/iphone15) preparing for it!
* I’ve updated my [Journal 4](/journal4) Shortcut and I’ll be updating my other Shortcuts soon. Especially the Clipboard Manager!

## …and privately:

* I’ve been dealing with a tragic family event since mid-August. I’m trying to be as supportive as I can to my brother (and his 2 kids), whose wife (and mum) died.
* School year has started but we’re still figuring out our daughters’ schedules.
* Need to improve my training schedule, too - my stats are out of whack and my body is out of shape!
