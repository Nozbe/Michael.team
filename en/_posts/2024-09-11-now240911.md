# On September 11 `24 I am…

…back in my [home office](/office) after summer holidays and getting ready for our annual [Nozbe reunion](/reunion)

<!--More-->

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* I’ve started [podcasting](/noofficefm) every other Wednesday now. Next week a new episode! [Last one about email was great](/noofficefm-48)
* I’ve redesigned [my weekly template aka “ideal week”](/week) so I can work better as the CEO/product/marketing guy
* I’m seeing the team get adjusted to the new size of 15 as we’re changing responsibilities and simplifying things. I love seeing people step up!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m so busy with [Nozbe](/nozbe) and podcasting, I don’t have time for much more. Especially that I’m podcasting also [in Polish](/pl/niemabiura)
* I’m considering what to do with my [NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) and when to finally finish it up. As I’m implementing my [CORE hours](/podcast-204/) better I'm tempted to write the CORE hours e-book this fall…
* I've redesigned the header on this blog - now the menu is always visible. Before it was hidden under "More…" which wasn't intuitive.

## …and privately:

* I’ve shared my love for the [Hamilton musical](/hamilton)
* I’m finishing my [Lego set](/lego) of Ferrari (photos, soon!)
* I’m hosting an exchange student as my eldest daughter is on the exchange in Brussels. Exciting times for my family!
