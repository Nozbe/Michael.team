# Ask Michael: Which apps do you use and recommend?

[AMA (Ask Michael Anything)](/ama) - is a series of posts I'm running on this blog inspired by hundreds of emails I received from [my readers](/ama) and [Nozbe users][n]. **Today I'll share the apps I use and recommend**, here goes:

## The Big Three: Evernote, Dropbox and Nozbe

I already wrote about it several times, but I use these three apps extensively and I have premium accounts on all of them:

* [Evernote][] for notes, documents and other "reference materials"
* [Dropbox][] for files
* [Nozbe][n] (duh!) for projects and tasks

But I use more apps. I wrote about some of them in my [#iPadOnly][] book, but here's an updated list in a semi-random order (as seen on [my iPhone 6 Plus](/6pluslove) home screen):



* Mail, Gmail - to check email, I use both. Gmail app has better search. Haven't tried "Inbox" app yet, is it any good?
* Maps, Google Maps, Navigon - for navigation - I tend to use the Apple's app a lot more these days.
* Runkeeper - for sports, all my trainings are there.
* 1Password - I store my passwords there, indespensable.
* Overcast, Audible - I don't read so much, I listen, to podcasts and audiobooks.
* Skitch, My Measures - my favorite "annotating" apps, take a picture and draw on top of it.
* Reeder - I still read RSS. I know, it's so 2010.
* Pocket - all my "read it later" articles go there, always something to read.
* More reading: Kindle, Bible (in Polish: Pismo Święte)
* Twitter, Facebook Paper, Instagram and LinkedIn - my social media browsing.
* 1Writer - my writing app on my iPhone 6 Plus, on my iPad I prefer Editorial. I also use AI Writer from time to time, I love its "focus mode".
* Chrome - my "other" browser - over there I'm logged in to Google's services. I'm not logged in to Google on my main browser - Safari.
* iMessage - my SMS replacement of choice. Only on iOS or Mac though.
* Whatsapp - my other SMS replacement, I love that it connects with people with both iOS and Android devices alike. Hate it that it doesn't have Watch app yet, nor iPad app.
* Slack - our chat in [Nozbe][n], we use the free version and we love the "slackbot" :-)
* Soulver - my calculator replacement
* Notability - something between Skitch and Evernote, use it from time to time.
* Grafio - sometimes I need to draw grahps
* iThoughts - my go-to mind mapping app, syncs via Dropbox with XMind on the Mac
* iMovie - I do all my movie editing on my iPhone. Love it.
* IMDB - I'm a movie freak: new releases, trailers... my favorite water-cooler.
* Coding group: Prompt, Transit and Textastic - SSH client, FTP client and a code editor.
* Office-like apps: I mostly use Numbers for spreadsheets, Pages for formatted texts and Keynote for presentations. I also have MS Office and Google's Drive apps for compatibility.

Whew, this list is not complete, but let's leave it like that. Soon I'll post my new [iMac 5K setup](/imac) where I'll share what I installed on my Mac when I got it.
