# Life is not the amount of breaths you take, it's the moments that take your breath away.


Just spent a great weekend with a couple of long-time friends and later my parents visited our home which doesn't happen all that often as we live a 5-hour drive from one another. These great moments reminded me of a quote from the movie [Hitch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/) - starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes.

Where Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (starring Will Smith) says:

> "Life is not the amount of breaths you take, it's the moments that take your breath away."

We live to enjoy these moments and create as many of these as possible.

## Think about your current friends, family...

How much time you're spending with them? Do you have enough time to do that? Do you dedicate them full attention they deserve? Do you work on your [productivity](/productivity) just to be able to get more WORK done? Or to create more time for these moments that take your breath away?

## ... and don't forget about your old friends, too.

Just recently I reconnected with an old-friend. We had a huge fight around 5 years ago. I made a mistake, he made one, too. We were young, irrational and we stopped talking... until recently...

I just still remembered these great moments we spent together years ago and couldn't believe we stopped talking over some stupid argument. I called and we reconnected and it feels like we never broke our friendship. Now we're closer than we've ever been.

## Life is short. People pass away quickly. Let's create moments that take breaths away.

This is why we want to be productive. Why we want to get more done. To enjoy life just a little more. To enjoy our family, friends and... to reconcile with people we split our ways in the past. Keeping grudges doesn't make any sense... and with years you actually forget why you had them in the first place... and they feel ridiculous.
