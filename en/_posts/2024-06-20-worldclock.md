# Apple Watch Ultra Modular as a World Clock

I'm lucky to be running [Nozbe][n] - an app used by [SMART business owners](/nozbe17) from all over the world. I live in Europe so I'm based in Central European Time which covers most of Europe, but what if I want to [talk to customers](/noofficefm-44) from different parts of United States or Asia? Luckily we there is a World Clock app on the iPad and modern calendars support time zones pretty well, but still I wanted to have a handy way to check what the time is now in different time zones.

## Modular Ultra watch face with World Clock complications

This year, like every year, on WWDC Apple didn't give us custom watch faces for the [Apple Watch](/applewatch). I'm no longer holding my breath for that. Luckily I can always customize my [Apple Watch Ultra](/ultra/) with complications and with one of the most flexible of the watch faces - **Modular Ultra**.

Also, many questionable design decisions with WatchOS 10, Apple brought us back the way to [swipe between watch faces](/watchfaces) so I can quickly change between different dedicated watch faces.

Now I have a special "World Clock" watch face configured with times in Los Angeles, Chicago/Texas, New York on top, my time in the center, world night-day complication and at the bottom I have London, Taipei and Tokyo.

## More dedicated watch faces?

Now come to think of it, I might be tempted to create more such dedicated watch faces based on this Modular Ultra as this way I can have a nice clock with lots of complications depending on their purpose. I'll keep you posted. Any watch faces recommendations?
