## Vacation from [Nozbe][n]

* I'm taking the month off from my day-to-day duties as CEO and VP of Marketing.
* We just successfully launched [Nozbe Teams on Product Hunt](/producthunt)
* Recorded first episodes for our upcoming podcasts: in English [NoOffice.fm](htps://NoOffice.fm) and in Polish [NieMaBiura.pl](https://NieMaBiura.pl) which our VP of Product, [Rafal](https://twitter.com/sobolowy) will launch this month!

## … and I'm 100% focused on writing my upcoming book:

* Writing [NoOffice](https://NoOffice.org) book - details in video below! I'm aiming at around 1500 words per day.
* Already wrote first chapters, [you can check progress and read my drafts online for free](https://NoOffice.org/book/)
* Will blog here and check email only [once a week](/once-a-week)

## … and privately?

* Spending the rest of my vacations with my family: Ewelina, my wife of 15 years and my 3 daughters: Milena (11), Emilia (7) and Liliana (just turned 4!)
