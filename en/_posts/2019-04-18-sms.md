# Challenge: social media sabbatical for a month

Yesterday with Radek we recorded the 184th episode of [“The Podcast”][p] where we’ll be discussing Cal Newport’s new book - Digital Minimalism ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525536515?tag=sliwinski-20)|[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/0241387779?tag=sliwinski-20)) - and the episode will air next week... but while recording Radek challenged me to do a fully-blown social media sabbatical (Twitter/Instagram/Facebook) for the next 30 days. No Twitter. No Instagram. No Facebook. No Social Media. And I accepted it! Here are the rules:

## Social Media Sabbatical Rules:

OK. Time to set up some ground rules. Here’s what I’ve done:

- I’ve deleted all my social media apps - Twitter, Tweetbot, Instagram and Facebook from all of my devices.
- I’ve logged out of Twitter/Facebook/Instagram from the browser on my Mac
- I’ve also removed Buffer app - so I will no longer be able to post stuff on social media.

There you go - no social media consumption and posting for me. No engagement.

## Automatic re-posting from blogs to Twitter will still be active

Yes, so the only exception to the sabbatical rule are the automatic posts that are done on my behalf - like the Twitter post about this very blog entry that goes out automatically when I write something here.

The same goes for my writing on Medium for NoOffice or Nozbe 4.

## Because blogging is allowed.

That’s the thing - I want to see if this sabbatical will actually help me blog more... I want to focus on writing more long-term content... not on the spur-of-the-moment rants on social media.

Maybe I‘ll also have more time to keep writing the [No Office book?](https://NoOffice.org/) Who knows...

## [Nozbe][n] will remain active on social media of course :-)

Yes, I‘m talking my personal social media use - not our company‘s use. Our social media manager [Kuba and the rest of the team](https://nozbe.com/about) will keep posting and being in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nozbe) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/Nozbe) and in our groups: [English](https://Nozbe.com/community) and [Polish](https://Nozbe.com/grupa), so no worries there.

## This ends on May 20?

Today is Wednesday, April 18 and with this announcement I’m starting my sabbatical. The end date will be a little more than month from now - Monday, May 20 - when I’ll turn 40. Yes, forty. Perfect day for the end of this experiment and my first impressions and conclusions.

## Do you accept the challenge?

How about you doing the same thing and going full cold-turkey on social media with me? You don’t have to report back to me (I won’t be seeing your social media replies for the next month anyway). [Just send me an email](/contact) when you decide to join me or better yet, ping me on May 20 together with some nice birthday greetings :-)

Wish me good luck off the grid... and good luck to you to, if you dare to accept this challenge, too!
