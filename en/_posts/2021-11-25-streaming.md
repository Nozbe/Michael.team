# Perfect zoom meeting setup or streaming kit in my new home office

Last year I read a blog post by [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt/) - the founder of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) where he explained his [high-quality streaming setup](https://ma.tt/2020/05/ceo-video-streaming/) - he revised this post [this year with more updates](https://ma.tt/2021/05/2021-streaming-kit/). Later [I read a similar post by Seth](https://seths.blog/2021/04/fixing-zoom-calls-looking-better-and-feeling-better/). As I do quite a few [interviews](/guest/), record [podcasts](/noofficefm/) and have some [zoom meetings](https://NoOffice.org/meetings/) with my [Nozbe][n] team, I decided to upgrade my setup, too. [I explained some of it in my latest "office update" post](/office22/) but here are more details:

## Virtual meetings rule 1 - get a better microphone

The built-in microphones are usually poor and if you buy a simple microphone and headset combo, McDonald's style, it's still not gonna be great. I recommend two microphones:

- [Samson Q2U](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Handheld-Microphone-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B07FKG8PGZ/ref=sr_1_6?tag=sliwinski-20) if you're on a budget (~$70), or:
- [Shure MV7](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML/?tag=sliwinski-20) if you're also podcasting regularly (~$250).

Both microphones can be connected to any computer with a simple USB cable. No additional hardware necessary.

## Virtual meetings rule 2 - get a better web cam

The webcams built in the modern computers are usually garbage. So the easiest way to improve this is to go out and buy a dedicated web cam. I recommend [Logitech Brio 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Calling-Noise-Canceling-Correction-Microsoft/dp/B01N5UOYC4/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) and the way you look will be much improved (~$150).

### Taking the looks to a different level with a dedicated camera and a teleprompter.

Now, to look really great, you need a professional camera, teleprompter and an external display. Here's the setup:

![{{ page.title }} 2](/img/streaming-2.jpg)

- [Sony ZV-E10 camera](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Content-Creators-Vlogging-Microphone/dp/B08965JV8D/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) - very good and much cheaper alternative to what Matt or Seth suggested ($650).
- [Neewer 28mm lens](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Aperture-Compatible-Mirrorless-Cameras/dp/B083SMLSCW/ref=sr_1_10?tag=sliwinski-20) so that I can have this camera much closer on my desk and be in focus ($70). Alternatively you can get the [Sigma 16mm auto-focus lens](https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-16mm-Contemporary-Lens-Sony/dp/B077BWD2BB/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) but this one costs much more (~$400).
- [Teleprompter PAD](https://www.amazon.com/TELEPROMPTER-PAD-TeleprompterPAD-iLight-Remote/dp/B01BMIM9PM/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) to mount the camera there (~$130).
- [Small 10" external monitor](https://www.amazon.com/WHOLEV-Monitors-1280X800-Security-Raspberry/dp/B07Q9875PQ/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) that fits under the teleprompter (~$100).
- [Elgato Camlink 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) so that you can connect the camera to your computer using HDMI (~$130).
- [Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Ethernet-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B06WWQ7KLV/ref=sr_1_3?tag=sliwinski-20) to connect the camera to the Camlink (~$8).

That's it. This is how this setup looks like from the back-stage:

![{{ page.title }} 3](/img/streaming-3.jpg)

In theory you can connect the Sony camera directly to the computer using the USB-C cable, but I found this solution to be very laggy and of poor quality. It's much better to use the HDMI port.

### Instead of the monitor you can use an iPad

Under the teleprompter you can use an iPad. Before I got the monitor I was using my wife's 2018 11" iPad Pro and hooked it to my old iMac with [Air Display app](https://avatron.com/applications/air-display/) which even has a [teleprompter mode](https://avatron.com/teleprompter/). However, as the data was streamed using Wifi and not HDMI cable, everything was very laggy again.

In the end the setup with a dedicated monitor is the best. If only I knew how to "flip screen horizontally" to achieve a teleprompter mode it'd be awesome. But for normal conversations it's not a problem.

## Virtual meetings rule 3 - get better lights!

As I live in Europe and very often I get to speak to people on the other side of the pond, in the USA, I need good lights to look good when it's evening here and day there.

I bought two sets of [Elgato Key Light](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Key-Light-Professional-App-Enabled/dp/B07L755X9G/ref=sr_1_2?tag=sliwinski-20) that work great. I have one installed right in front of my face, behind the teleprompter and the other one to the side at a 45 degree angle (~$150 each, total of ~$300).

## Virtual meeting bonus tip - don't stare at yourself!

Now that you look good, there is a pro-tip that Seth mentioned in his article - you can actually hide "self view" when on a Zoom call. Just click on the "â€¦" icon and choose "Hide self view".

This is glorious. We as humans are not designed to be staring at ourselves through the mirror all day.

## That's it - enjoy your better video calls and interviews!

This setup is not cheap, but if that's what you're doing professionally, it's worth it! My version cost me:

- $250 for the microphone
- $1088 for the camera gear
- $300 for the lights

So a little over one and a half grand total.

And if you want to be able to use lots of cool backgrounds when streaming, get [Elgato Green Screen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QWMS7X5/ref=srdp?tag=sliwinski-20) (~$130).

## Want to save money? Don't have that many meetings!

Just read the chapter of my [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/), where I explain that [Meetings are optional](https://NoOffice.org/meetings/).
