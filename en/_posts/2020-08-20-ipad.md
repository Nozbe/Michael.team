# A decade with an iPad - what a delightful computer!

This year the device I'm writing these words on, turned exactly 10. A whole decade. What launched as a *bigger iPod* and a *consumption device* as described by the tech press, turned out to be a very capable device which I'm using right now to write my [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/). Here's my short history with an iPad:

<!--More-->

## From the iPad 1 to the iPad Pro[^1]

I bought my first iPad (which I still proudly own) right after the launch in 2010 as we were working on a [Nozbe][n] app for it. In the beginning it was a purely consumption device for me an I didn't see much use for it apart from watching some movies and browsing the web. For this reason I entirely skipped iPad 2 but when the iPad went *retina* with the iPad 3, I bought it and my [iPadOnly journey began](https://sliwinski.com/part-1-the-clouds-ipad-as-my-main-computer) as I started configuring this thing to be able to work on it almost exclusively.

By the end of 2012 I was already [iPadOnly](/tag/ipadonly) when I upgraded to the iPad 4. I wrote my entire [iPadOnly book](https://iPadOnly.com) on it together with my friend [Augusto Pinaud](https://productivityvoice.com).

Later I went through several upgrades. I got the iPad Air and later the iPad Air 2.

When the iPad Pro was announced, I immediately went with the 12.9" version as I thought the bigger would be better. I was wrong.

## Bigger is not always better

I hated the huge iPad Pro size. It was too big to be used in portrait mode. To clunky to carry around. I lasted half a year, until Apple announced the smaller [iPad Pro 9,7"](https://sliwinski.com/twoipads/) which I bought to test the latest iOS beta but finally [fell in love with it](https://sliwinski.com/babyipad) and made it my main device.

I realized that a small iPad is big enough for me to work on and yet joy to carry around and just use anywhere I want. A smaller iPad brought me back to the happy place where I could use it for work, fun and anything in between.

## New iPad Pro 10,5" and 11" just made the iPad perfect.

Later the newer [iPad Pro 10,5"](https://sliwinski.com/ipadwork/) and [iPad Pro 11](https://sliwinski.com/whichipad) just perfected the machine. Smaller bezels, no more home button, Face ID... it all just made the iPad a perfect companion for me to use every day.

Here's a comparison of the iPad 1, the 10,5" and the 11":

## Better accessories: Pencil and Smart/Magic keyboards sealed the deal!

The Pencil 1 was a nice accessory but I love Pencil 2 as it's always charged and it's always ready to be used. Especially with my favorite writing app - [Linea Sketch](https://linea-app.com).

In the beginning I was using Logitech keyboards, especially the [Ultrathin models](https://sliwinski.com/ultrathin/). In fact, I still use [Logitech K760 with the iMac on my desk](https://sliwinski.com/desk).

However, first the [Smart Keyboard](https://sliwinski.com/ipadstuff) and later the [Magic Keyboard](https://sliwinski.com/magic) which is [really cool](https://sliwinski.com/backlit) and I'm using it now to write these words for you.

## Writing #NoOffice book only on the iPad is pure joy

As I described it on the [#NoOffice about page](https://nooffice.org/about/) I write this book entirely on the iPad. I write in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), sync it with [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) which I use to post [new chapters](https://NoOffice.org/book/) to [GitHub](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org).

I spend the first half of August 2020 traveling with my family. We were living in 3 separate AirBNB houses and 4 hotels. My iPad was always with me. Always ready to write. In places like these:

> iPad is a real computer. And it's a delightful one at that. I can't imagine my work without it.

## But really, how was it that the iPad came to be?

Now that you know the iPad is a joy to use and it does the job for me, if you're curious how it initially came to be, check out this video by my favorite vlogger, [Rene Ritchie](https://reneritchie.net).
