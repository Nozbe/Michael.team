# I am number four

A short follow up to my [last interview blog post][in] to inspire you even more that anyone can achieve almost anything :-) A few months ago one of the productivity blogs posted [an infographic of the top 10 productivity gurus on the Internet][td] and I made it to number 4 on the list with the influence score of 66 right behind great folks like [Tim Ferriss (score 86)][t1], [David Allen (score 80)][t2] and [Craig Jarrow (score 76)][t3].

Although my ego felt really good about myself after this publication, one must not forget that this all only means I'm on the right track and I should keep on keepin' on. That's it, nothing more ;-)

**Hope you follow the others from the list**

This post is not about myself, but more about the company I'm privileged to be in. I totally recommend following these guys:

* Read the book ["Four hour workweek"][d1] by Tim Ferriss
* Read the book ["Getting Things Done"][d2] by David Allen
* Subscribe to Craig's blog ["Time Mamagement Ninja"][d3]
* Subscribe to Stever Robbins' ["Get-it-done-guy podcast"][d4]
* Check out Tara Rodden Robinson (she's mentoring the [GTD Study Group][d5])
* and I plan to check out everyone else from this list...

**Who isn't on the list and should be**

Many of the interviewees of the [Productive! Magazine][p] were not included in the list (and they should have been...) like Michael Hyatt, Augusto Pinaud, Laura Stack, Graham Allcott, Jason Womack and many others... so just [get the past issues of the magazine][p] to learn all about them and what they are up to. They are the real gurus for me.

P.S. The title of the blog post is a pun (intended) to a movie I actually haven't seen... :-)

***Question:** Who's your guru? Why? Who inspires you regularly to really get it going?*
