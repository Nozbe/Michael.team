# Productive! Magazine is growing with the first issue of a Dutch version!

When in 2008 I launched the [Productive! Magazine][] as a free PDF I had one thing in mind: *I'm already offering a [great productivity tool][Nozbe]... but what is a tool without a constant flood of inspiration?*

Fast forward today and not only do we have [Productive! Magazine][] as a monthly magazine in the form of an app for the iPhone, iPad and Android platforms... but the "productivity platofrm" I initiated has now local versions in [Polish][pl], [Spanish][pe], [Japanese][pj] and now... (drumrolls!) in [Dutch][pn]!

I'm really proud of our [Productive! Magazine Dutch][pn] team:

* [**Fokke Koistra**](http://twitter.com/kiddokay) of Think Productive Benelux - editor in chief
* **Callista Vink** - assistant editor
* **Magda Blaszczyk** - executive editor of [Productive! Magazine][] and coordinator of all the issues together with Radziu and Radek of our [Nozbe][n] team.

## What's in the first issue of the Dutch magazine?

Interview with yours truly as well as articles by leading Dutch-speaking productivity experts like: Gonny van der Zwaag, Bart Timmers, Grace Marshall, Frank Meeuwsen, Marcel van der Berg, Martijn Aslander... as well as Graham Allcott and Juan Antonio Dominion.

As always - the idea is that our localized magazines are really local - written by local experts and for the local community... and in 2015 the Dutch version will be a quarterly magazine... and if it gains traction Fokke promised to prepare new issues more frequently, so make sure to [check it out, if you speak Dutch!][pn]

**Fun fact:** When [I launched Nozbe back in 2007](https://sliwinski.com/interview) I posted about it on Frank Meeuwsen's blog *"What's the Next Action?"* and that post catapulted Nozbe's popularity. Now Frank is a good friend and one of the contributors to our magazine. World is indeed a small place... and a great (and productive!) one at that!

***Question:** Have you checked our local versions of Productive! Magazine? Which ones? Do you read regularly our main magazine?*
