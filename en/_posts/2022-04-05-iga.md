# Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek is now 1GA - Number 1 Female Tennis Player in the world!

A few years back, [I started training tennis](/tennis/) and I slowly became a fan of the sport. And now I‚Äôm so happy and proud of the first female athlete from my country who became a number 1 in tennis - [Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_≈öwiƒÖtek)!

## What a career for Iga!

It's amazing to witness such a career and I'm hoping to be watching it over next decades. After all, Iga will turn 21 next month so she's got years to play! And she's already number 1!

[She won Roland Garros - French Open 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_French_Open_‚Äì_Women%27s_singles) and after that she just kept going. This year she won three **WTA1000** games and as [Ashleigh Barty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Barty) resigned from tennis, Iga became the number 1 in the world!

## I love ‚ù§Ô∏è having great sports role models!

In the past I wrote about [Adam Ma≈Çysz](/adam-malysz-my-perfect-humble-and-inspiring-r/) - my perfect role model. Now Iga is proving to be a similar person - humble, competitive, driven and courageous‚Ä¶ and just overall very nice person to be around. A person like her can become a great female role model for my daughters.

I saw her last year in Gdynia, where before the Olympics in Japan she was opening [Poland Open WTA250](https://bnpparibaspolandopen.pl/en/) for show with [Hubert Hurkacz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz).
