# On October 13 I am…

I just came back from our annual [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion), this time in Katowice, Poland. We had a great time bonding together and seeing each other after a difficult year for our company, [Nozbe][n] - and we took a moment to celebrate that things are looking up for us!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We just spent a week in-person in Katowice on our annual reunion - so great to be around your favorite people who normally you don’t see in person!
* We just celebrated a few milestones as far as our customer counts are concerned. We’re happy things are looking up for our small app [Nozbe][n]!
* We agreed on our CORE values - PSFF - **Passion, Simplicity, Freedom and Fairness**. More on that later in a blog post!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’ve started geeking out in Siri Shortcuts. On Monday I’ll publish a new version of my [Journaling shortcut](/journal).
* But that’s not all! I’ve also used my skills to prepare a way to publish Threads on Twitter and LinkedIn from the same content! More details soon.
* And then I decided to create my own version of [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter) for the iPad using Siri Shortcuts. This way I can create amazing presentations from my blog posts and other content.

## …and privately:

* My daughters started a new year at school - they’re using a school bus now and they’re doing great and having fun at school. All three of them.
* We accepted a son of our friends as guest student for the semester - he lives with us - so I have 4 kids at home now and my first “son”!
* I’m back at doing [sports again](/sports) and to motivate myself I got a new gadget - [Apple Watch](/applewatch) Ultra 2 - let’s finish this year off with a bang! And quite a few kg less!
