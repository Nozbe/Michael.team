# No Office FM #90: How to Use AI in Your Work

A very packed episode where I talked about how we use AI 🤖 at Nozbe and how we are now incorporating it into our product, after all we’ve learned. ✅ I share a presentation where I explain our usage of AI: research, learning, writing, drafting, translating and coding… 🤓 Best practices when using AI and why you should always verify what it’s doing! 😱 Examples of “creepy AI” or where it’s borderline science fiction now… ☑️ And I finish it off by showing how we’re approaching AI in our product - how we want to make Nozbe smarter and more useful for you thanks to AI. Let me know if you liked this show, how did you like this solo episode and what would you like to hear next from me!
