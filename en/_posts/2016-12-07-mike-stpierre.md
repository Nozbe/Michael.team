# Interview with Mike St Pierre - Getting Things Done at schools - Productive! Show #104

Mike is a great friend. I originally did this interview with him for the [Nozbe blog][n]. He is a blogger, host of "The Emergent Leader Podcast", and ex-president of Morris Catholic High School and a father of 4 children. As you might guess, he uses Nozbe to get organized with all his projects. In this interview he explains how we uses [Nozbe.how][h] templates to create more structured projects and we dive deeper into the "weekly review" concept and why it's so important!
