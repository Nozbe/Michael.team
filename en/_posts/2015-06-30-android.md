about our recent advancements we did on the Android platform. I'm linking to it because this is really important. We spent lots of development time to finally make Nozbe fly on Androids lower than 4.4. And apart from that, we added a widget. [Our version 2.1.8 is the best Android-optimized version yet][s]:

I'm really proud of my team here. We managed to improve performance on Android, add a cool widget... And in the new version 2.1.9 which is coming in a few weeks we'll have improved performance even more!

You know, I'm an Apple kind of guy but [Nozbe][n] is about being true to all the platforms it supports so I'm happy to report we're really making Android a first class citizen in our ecosystem.
