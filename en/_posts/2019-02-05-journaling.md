# How intermittent journaling and some smart Siri shortcuts help me enjoy more intentional and productive days

I love journaling. [I’ve blogged about it in the past](/journal) and the same rules basically apply today. I’ve also been more conscious about planning my days and I’ve also [blogged about my workflows](/workflows) for it in the past. Today I’ll be joining both concepts together, with my up-to-date workflows (Siri shortcuts) and a new concept I’ve been trying lately - intermittent journaling. Here goes:

## Using Siri Shortcuts and Bear app

Because I’m using iOS devices to get my stuff done - [I’m iPadOnly](/ipadonly) with the [new 11” iPad Pro](/whichipad) and [I use an iPhoneXS](/newdevice) - I do all of my planning an journaling on either of these devices using Siri Shortcuts and the [Bear note-taking app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3vvCJ&ct=sliwinski). I don’t use Bear for anything else - just for planning my days and for journaling.

You’ll find below my Siri shortcuts for both planning the days and journaling:

## Siri shortcuts to plan the day:

- [**Plan - Today**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4627f45c9bd646458112d29608567519) - this shortcut either opens a new Bear note with today’s plan or adds a new note if it’s not there yet.
- [**Plan - Tomorrow**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d3a1bf1a04e042d0bfecbde0416a7760) - this shortcut does exactly the same thing but for tomorrow.
- [**Plan - Read Rocks**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d72b2e9b2cf74aa481e88e6669e0ba9c) - this shortcut helps me read my day’s plan and use it in other shortcuts - like the journaling ones below.

## Siri shortcuts to journal:

- [**Journal - Day**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0d6c6a4b836c4673bc4f0b1936a5d03a) - main journaling shortcut I launch in the morning.
- [**Journal - Night**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/21b0dccd56804f5aba2f5424f8565900) - main journaling shortcut I launch in the evening.

For these shortcuts to work, you also need these smaller shortcuts that I use inside them to get everything done:

- [**Journal - Get Goals**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4d07579fcc8b42b2a0e1e4100727d4d3) - reminds me of my monthly goals every day before I start to journal
- [**Journal - Compose**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f52a3fe1aa8242328d60307fa2df7425) - asks me journaling questions and composes the journal entry
- [**Journal - Save **](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6d154629f6734746a79b8a2f87e7047e) - saves the journaling entry in Bear

Now that you’ve got all of the above shortcuts, you can see how they work together. Both the planning and journaling shortcuts are inter-connected.

## Intermittent journaling with all these shortcuts - how my day goes:

**Evening**

My day starts in the evening as I summarize my day and get ready for tomorrow. I launch my **Journal - Night** shortcut, answer some questions and within the shortcut I’m being redirected to the **Plan - Tomorrow** shortcut where I plan my day. Now that I’ve journaled and planned the next day, I can go to sleep.

**Morning**

In the morning I launch my **Journal - Day** shortcut and again, answer some questions and within the shortcut I’m being redirected to **Plan - Today** shortcut to make sure I review my plan and make adjustments.

**Day**

At the end of the morning journaling session a whole checklist is added to my daily plan with each checkbox for each 30 minute interval:

> 9 - 9:30  Meet - Deep - Work
> 9:30 - 10 Meet - Deep - Work 
> etc...

And as the day goes, after every 30 minutes I’m using the Bear’s quasi-Markdown formatting and I’m making bold one of these three options... or none of them... and right next to it I write what actually happened. Here’s how I ended my workday today:

## Intermittent journaling keeps me focused and helps me see where my time goes

I got the idea of intermittent or [interstitial journaling from this article.](https://betterhumans.coach.me/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef)

If I procrastinate for 30 minutes and just browse mindlessly through the web... I write it down... if I manage to do some good deep work session, I write it down, too - and mark the “Deep” word in bold. When I do sports, I write it down.

This way I’m very aware of how my day is going!

Anyway, I’ve been doing this for the last few weeks and I really like how my days are going - more mindful work, less procrastination, more focused time... even though I’m spending a few moments every 30 minutes writing things down.

Hope this helps you stay productive, too!
