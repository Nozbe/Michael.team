# Last year's interview with Marcus Platt on Little Book of Nozbe

This interview was published last year on our [Nozbe YouTube Channel][y] but it's very relevant still for people trying out getting organized with [Nozbe][n] - and it's an amazing example of why I love what I do, when I get to talk to fans of our work who build something new based on it. This is what Marcus did - he wrote a book about Nozbe [Little Book Of Nozbe][l] and a [lite version][lv] and now updated it to [Nozbe 3][n]. In this interview you'll learn behind the scenes of how the book came to be and what was his motivation to write it and our to help him promote it :-)
