# Productive! Magazine on the Android phone, tablet or phablet near you

As I mentioned in my [last post](https://sliwinski.com/summary2013) one of my team's biggest achievements in 2013 was re-launching [Productive! Magazine][] as an iPhone and iPad app. And our plans were even more ambitious than that. We also wanted to have an Android app and **today we're launching your favorite productivity magazine on [Android platform][a]**

**Visit [Productive! Magazine][] web site and read online on your computer or mobile phone... or get our [Android app][a] or [iPhone/iPad app][b] - both are free!**

As you know I'm a big fan of Apple iGadgets but I also had Android devices  in the past and although [I don't approve of Google's privacy policies](https://sliwinski.com/no-android) I believe in choice and if one prefers an Android phone or tablet I'll be more than happy to oblige. After all, we've been having [Nozbe][n] Android apps for quite some time now.

## Productive! Magazine 17 soon!

We'll soon reveal our 17th issue of our magazine so stay tuned and if you want to make sure you'll get it on time, please visit our [Productive! Magazine][] site and get our apps. Thanks to [Nozbe][n]'s sponsorship I can offer you the inspiration and advice of the best productivity experts on the internet for free :-)
