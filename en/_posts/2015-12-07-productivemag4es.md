# Productive! Magazine In Spanish, issue 4 with José Miguel Bolivar

I'm so proud of our [Productive! Magazine][pm] network growing and later this week we'll publish the 31st issue of our global one in English, but our Spanish franchise keeps growing, too. Now with my good friend [Josep][j] running the show with [Augusto][ja] and a great bunch of Spanish-speaking productivity bloggers, they have just delivered yet another great issue:

*Note: this magazine is in Spanish, but as I do speak this language and I have quite a few Spanish-speaking readers out there, I wanted to share this news. And I'm really proud of the team behind this project!*

## Interview with José Miguel Bolivar

Who is a well known productivity expert with amazing knowledge of GTD (Getting Things Done system by David Allen). Lots of great tips in this interview Augusto did with him. 

## Great articles about...

...implementing GTD, learning to improve your skills and to manage your energy, and to start new habits... And so much more!

*Thanks again to [Josep Maria Martinez][j] for putting this issue together! Fantastic job!*
