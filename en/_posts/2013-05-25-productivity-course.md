# Launching 10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity Course

Last year [I announced on this blog][p1] that I was planning to record a new [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity Course][nc]. It was a big deal for me, the [2008 course][ncold] was viewed more than 120,000 times on YouTube and our great [Nozbe customers][n] needed an update. It was a very [scary project][p3], recorded almost entirely by me in 5 languages (I got help in Japanese :-) but finally [we recorded][p2] and today let me show the course's trailer and invite you to view the course in English:

<!--More-->

You can also [watch this 10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity Course on YouTube][yt]. As you can see, I recorded the course in 4 languages and did intros in Japanese. I've poured my heart and soul into it. I sure hope it was worth it. I sure hope people will look past my accent (I'm Polish, so English, German, Spanish and Japanese are not my mother tongues :-) and focus on the content. That's the idea. Each lesson is short and to the point (~5 minutes).

**Today I invite you to [watch the course in English][nc]**

Over the course of the next weeks we'll also launch the course in German, Spanish, Polish and Japanese but today I invite you to watch it in English:

**[Introduction](http://www.nozbe.com/course) - what the course is all about**

**[Step 1 - "Inbox"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-1-inbox) - how to manage all of your inputs**

**[Step 3 - "Next Actions"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-3-next-actions) - what they are and how to find them and focus on them**

**[Step 4 - "Mobility"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-4-mobility) - how to get things done anywhere, with any device...**

**[Step 5 - "Collaboration"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-5-collaboration) - how to get things done with others - learn to finally delegate tasks and create synergies**

**[Step 8 - "Weekly Review"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-8-review) - why it's so important to review your productivity regularly.**

**[Step 9 - "Email"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-9-email) - how to deal with the flood of incoming email messages and how to get your inbox to zero**

**[Step 10 - "Get It All Done"](http://www.nozbe.com/course-10-get-all-done) - how to start and implement everything you've learned in the past lessons and create your Perfect Productivity System (TM)**

**I wanted to sell the course first... but it's free thanks to [Nozbe][n]**

The material of the course is very generic and can be applied to any productivity tool you'll use (including pen and paper) even though I give lots of examples from Nozbe there (well, it's the tool I use, right?).

I initially pondered about the idea of charging for the course. Based on the other courses out there, I could have easily charged a few hundred bucks for it and I'd find many happy customers. After all, recording the course, hiring a professional crew, professional translators, make-up artist and overall getting this project done cost us lots of money... but I decided this material should be available to anyone - even if they don't end up [among close to 200,000 happy Nozbe users][n] they should at least learn a few productivity tips and tricks.

That's why the course is free, generously sponsored by [Nozbe][n]. 

**[Go check out the course][nc] and let me know what you think**

And if your mother tongue is German, Spanish, Polish or Japanese, wait a week or so and you'll enjoy the course in your language.

**One more thing for [Nozbe users][n]**

We're preparing a special "Introduction to Nozbe" video screencast showing you the basics of [Nozbe][n] from the point of a new Nozbe user, based on the 10 steps outlined in the course. This video screencast is also coming very soon and will be included in thew new [Nozbe web app][n] and in our [native desktop and tablet apps][na].

***Question:** How did you like the course? Did you enjoy it? What is missing? What can be enhanced? What would you like to learn more about?*
