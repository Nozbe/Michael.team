# Where are you based?

📍 Where are you based? Simple question with a complicated answer, because as a #NoOffice company we're based on the Internet. So I answer: NOZBE dot COM

## 🤣 They laugh… and they are confused!

Then they keep asking where the REAL Nozbe office is.

🤩 Perhaps they expect a neon sign, fancy reception, big building in the center of a city… the whole thing…

I get it. For many, a company only looks serious if it has an address. Preferably the one you can show off to your customers.

Here’s the funny part:

🤝 I probably meet our customers more than most founders with “real” offices.

🎧 Twice a week, I spend several hours in online meetings — talking, learning, fixing problems.

No commuting. No shiny conference rooms. Just actual work happening.

Not having an office doesn’t mean we’re not serious.

It means we’ve designed a way to focus on what actually matters: helping our customers, building the product, and delivering results.

So next time someone tells you that a company needs a downtown HQ to be credible, just remember:

> sometimes, your office is just where the work happens — and that might be in your pajamas.
