# How to re-enable swipe gesture between watch faces in Apple Watch OS 10.2

I love my [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra) but what I didn‘t like about it was that it came with the WatchOS 10 which removed the ability to quickly swipe between watch faces. As a person who likes changing watch faces and configuring them with different complications depending on the time of day or the day of the week - it was really annoying. Luckily this option is back now!

## How to enable swiping between watch faces?

[Apple](/apple) didn’t make it easy for us. When I upgraded to WatchOS 10.2 I couldn’t find this option anywhere. I looked in on the iPhone, on the Watch in Settings… and couldn’t find it.

Finally I did, you have to scroll down to: **Settings > Clock** on the Apple Watch and then you’ll see: **Swipe to Switch Watch Face** and enable it.

Now you can be like me and keep configuring the watch faces according to your needs and swiping between them anytime!
