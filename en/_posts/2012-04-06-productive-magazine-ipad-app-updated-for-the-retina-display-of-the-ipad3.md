# Productive! Magazine iPad app updated for the Retina Display of the iPad3


We're happy to announce that our Productive! Magazine iPad app has been updated to support the Retina display of the iPad 3. If you don't have our app, get it from the App Store or just check for updates on your iPad.

The only small problem though is that the magazines as such don't support the Retina display very well. There are readable but far from "stunning" as they used to be on the old iPads. We're working on this issue now and hopefully we'll find a solution soon, so stay tuned. Meanwhile I encourage you to get an app like GoodReader and read our PDFs on the iPad and compare the reading experience. Anyway, thanks for your support. Issue #12 with Jason Womack is just around the corner, so stay tuned!
