# No Office FM #5: How to deal with emails?

Welcome to the episode #5 of my podcast about working remotely with Rafal, [Nozbe][n]'s VP of Product. In this 5th episode of the [No Office podcast](/tag/noofficefm) we talk about how we deal with emails. Itâ€™s all about our love-hate relationship with email. Check it out (and if youâ€™re looking for episode 4 of this podcast, we published my [last webinar](/differently) as a podcast).
