# Element Talks 2016 - great conference and audience

This probably was the **best conference I've ever been to**. I was invited as a speaker and for the first time I had to deliver an inspirational talk in front of an audience of almost 2000 people! But it wasn't just that, the entire event was just very well organized and executed.

## The biggest audience yet…

I haven't performed in front of so many people before. Also, it was a designer conference and I was invited to talk about [productivity](/productivity). My talk was delivered in Polish, but there are subtitles available:

Here's how the audience looked like from the stage (shot on my [iPhone 6s Plus](/6pluslove/)):

## The stage was intimidating…

I was talking about obvious things (to me) but for this audience things seemed new, like the [2-minute rule](/its-just-2-minutes-and-its-a-lot-of-time/):

I was also a little intimidated by so much tech and so many screens. Again, this conference was very professionally done:

Overall, the feeling of delivering a talk in front of such a crowd of people who probably have never heard of me, was something else:

## The organization of this conference was amazing!

The conference [organizers](https://www.elementtalks.com): **[Paulina Kacprzak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulaka/)** and **[Olga Rafalska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgarafalska/)** did an amazing job and made me feel so welcome and so taken care of.

They organized a cool "evening party" for the speakers before the conference, where we could get to know each other more. I wish more conferences would prepare something like that:

## We even got to support the conference a little…

We also chose to be one of the sponsors of this conference and we had a booth where we'd show [Nozbe][n] and give away [fudge](/podcast-44/).

Here's a short video that we put together so you can see how it all looked from backstage:

## My favorite speaker was Luke Hayman!

Out of all the speakers, my favorite, and the one I connected most with, was [Luke Hayman](https://www.pentagram.com/about/luke-hayman) of [Pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_firm)). Here's his talk and it was a great peek behind the curtain of this renowned design consultancy:
