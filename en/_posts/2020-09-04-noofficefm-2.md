# No Office FM: The Power of Small Teams

Welcome to the episode # 2 of my new podcast about working remotely with Rafal, [Nozbe][n]'s VP of Product. In the second episode of the [No Office podcast](/tag/noofficefm) we talk about the power of small teams like ours. How small teams can build great relationships with their customers, how I regularly talk to them to get to know their needs and of course, how cool it really is to be a small team developing a collaboration app from small teams.
