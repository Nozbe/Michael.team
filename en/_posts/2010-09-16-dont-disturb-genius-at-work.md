# Don't disturb - genius at work


Starting this September we moved to a new home with my family and I had to set up my new home office all over again. It's my third home office in 3 years, I previously featured [my first one based on Ikea cabinet](/declutter-your-desk-why-i-love-my-clutter-fre), later in a new apartment I had a[ separate room with a big wide desk](/christmas-cleaning-clutter-free-productive-ho), and this time I also have a separate room, but for many practical reasons I focused on building it as minimalistic as possible and with mostly IKEA furniture - here's a sneak peak of the work-in-progress:

## Why "genius at work"? I'm no genius, but I love this kind of genius work!

The office is almost ready and I'll post more pictures soon, but in this post I'd like to focus on the key question - why am I doing all this mess and why do I take so much time to build my own home office?

## Why am I building a home office myself?

I just moved to a new place. There are many things to take care of. I'm also ultra-busy running a successful [productivity software company][n] and a [magazine](/magazine/)... and yet I take my time to build a perfect home office just for me. Why?

## It's where I get things done

I don't rent an office. I work from home. My home office is my office. All of my co-workers work from home. It's essential to create the best working environment for myself so that I can really get some serious stuff done. I'm actually going to write a book about it :-) Yes, it is a lifestyle choice and I love it.

## It's where I feel great

I want my office to be "my thing" and I want to feel great there. This is why I'm taking so much time to build it right. I never expected to move to a new home last year... or the year before... but I love to move and live in different places and when I do - I want to have a good working environment there.

## It's pure fun

I love doing it. I love figuring out how to put cables, how to mount my gear, how to design my tables, how to... basically everything. I love the process and it makes me feel great. And it makes my home office really "mine".

## What about that "genius"?

Well, when I was young and I didn't want my parents to disturb me, I'd put a sign on my door: "Don't disturb, genius at work" - now that I get to build my own home office it reminds me of these times. I may actually put a similar sign on the door again to let the rest of my family know I'm working... we'll see :-)

More details and pics next week - you'll see how my "genius zone" looks after it's done. It's almost done and I love it already! How does your genius zone look like?
