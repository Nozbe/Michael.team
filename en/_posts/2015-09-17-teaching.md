# My main competitor: non-consumption. That's why I want to teach productivity rather than just sell Nozbe

Just a little over a month ago I was on the plane from my home town to my parents' place. I was reading [Jeff Walker's Launch book][j] after having seen his and [Michael Hyatt's videos][h] on launching new products. I'm not launching anything new. I still run [Nozbe][n] but for many people who don't know my product, it is actually new to them. And the whole world of [productivity](/productivity) is new to them. They just need to get organized. And on that plane ride I came up with an idea how to make this happen:

I developed the **[How to create your perfect digital productivity system][n]** course where in 3 videos I take someone from not having a system to having something that works and helps them get more stuff done. 

I've always been about teaching people productivity.

That's why I prepared the [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity Course][c]. That's why I'm the editor of the [Productive! Magazine][p]. That's why I'm recording [Productive! Show](/show). When you think about it I've always been teaching productivity...

So why this [new course][n] is different?

Because this time it's a mixture of great know-how with practical exercises presented as screencasts done in my productivity app. This time people can just follow along and get from "zero to hero" in no-time. Here's the intro:

**I'm closing this course today at midnight PDT** and I'll study the results and feedback I've gotten from my course participants. I want to know if this really makes sense and if I should improve this course in any way before I decide to offer it again. 

Task/Project management space is a crowded market but I believe my main competitor is not another to-do app, but traditional post-it notes, paper calendar and email. Old habits die hard. And with this course I'm trying to change them. 

[Please sign up][n] and let me know your thoughts if the course does the job well in the comments below. 

***Question:*** *Do you think I'm doing the right thing teaching everything I know about productivity?*

PS: As a bonus here's a video of Jason Fried, one of my business mentors, talking about out-teaching vs out-selling competition:
