# On January 2 `26 I am…

…beginning 2026 with new hopes, dreams and aspirations! I have high hopes for this one!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* 🤖 We are preparing to celebrate 19 years of [Nozbe][n] with launching first AI features already this January! Starting the year with a bang 💥
* In February we’ll be adjusting (meaning - increasing a little) the prices of Nozbe. So you better get your yearly plans in January to take advantage of the old (lower) prices. As we invest in AI and as the inflation goes up, we need to be adjusting our prices from time to time…
* And we’ll have a special offer for private use (families) in February to make up for the price change, so stay tuned!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m going to keep posting regularly on [LinkedIn](https://michael.gratis/in) and preparing new ways of spreading the [productivity](/productivity) message.
* I’m re-adjusting the schedule of our [NoOffice podcasts](/noofficefm) for this year and getting ready for some new [Webinars](/webinars) which we haven’t done in a while!
* I’m finishing work on a great update to the [Journaling Shortcut](/journal) as well as a completely re-written [Clipboard Manager](/clipboard) - so stay tuned for that!

## …and privately:

* I’m writing my [yearly summary](/year) now - I’m glad 2025 is over! It had some dark moments…
* I’m making a new training plan for new year - I haven’t been doing sports as much as I liked - and I want to change that.
* I’m happy to be starting off this year close to my family and friends - tomorrow we’ll be singing carols together!
