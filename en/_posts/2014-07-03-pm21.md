## Getting laid off was a blessing in disguise?

I really enjoyed my interview with **Pat Flynn** — a serial entrepreneur for whom getting laid off was the best thing that ever happened to him. Only then did he found out how to run business and earn money and be able to spend the majority of time with his family and on the stuff he likes:

> "The passive income part was very much inspired by Tim Ferris’s The 4-Hour Workweek and his ability to put systems and automation into his businesses. The idea is that you don’t have to be present in order for transactions to happen."

I totally get what Pat is talking about. [Nozbe][n] works the same way - I don't have to be there waiting to greet each and every new customer who signs up, although I'd really like to :-)

But there's more:
