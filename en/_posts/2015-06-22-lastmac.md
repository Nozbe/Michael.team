# My first iMac makes my Apple device lineup complete

After months of fighting it I finally gave in and bought a Retina iMac 5K. This purchase makes my lineup of Apple devices complete. In this short post I'd like to share a few thoughts on why I bought the iMac and what each of the Apple devices mean to me:

1. **Apple Watch** - it's a remote control for my iPhone. I [love it so far](https://sliwinski.com/watch-5days) and [here's how I've set it up](https://sliwinski.com/applewatchsetup). It's a very natural extension of my smartphone.
2. **iPhone 6 Plus** - my [main computing device](https://sliwinski.com/6pluslove) - I'm writing this blog post on it. I'm not [iPhone-only](https://sliwinski.com/iphoneonly) apparently but I spend 40-50% time on my iPhone every day.
3. **iPad Air 2** - my [main mobile machine](/ipadonly). Thanks to switching mainly to iPad and writing the [#iPadOnly][] book I've totally changed the way I use my personal computer. I use it 30-40% of my day.
4. **Macbook PRO** - I thought it'd be the [last PC I ever buy](https://sliwinski.com/my-last-pc) but eventually I replaced it today with my new iMac. My wife will be getting it so it stays in our household. This way we'll always have a laptop should we need one.
5. **iMac Retina 5k** - my new PC. Thanks to the fact that [everything I use is in the cloud](https://sliwinski.com/productivity-apps) I now can enjoy an enormous screen if I need one - and it's there in my [home office](https://sliwinski.com/teleworking). I'll be using it 20-30% of my day... And I already love looking at this gorgeous screen. 

Thanks to the fact that I work mostly on iOS devices I now can easily incorporate my new iMac into my flow.

I guess I'm now a perfect Apple customer with their entire lineup in my household... Well, I'm really happy with my setup now:

> productivity on Retina screens :-) 

***Question:*** *did you get the latest iMac? How do you like it so far?*
