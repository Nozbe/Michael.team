# Nozbe Teams Product Vlog 2 - API, hashtags, pins, links to tasks and more!

In this next episode of our [Nozbe Teams][n] vlog, we discuss the latest smaller features that were introduced in our product. Like finally we’ve got an API which we’ll use for some really interesting integrations, as well as small improvements like “hashtags” to add tasks parameters, bulk edit of tasks (finally!) and much more!

I like diving deep into these small quality-of-life improvements. I think they make the task-based communication through Nozbe so much easier!
