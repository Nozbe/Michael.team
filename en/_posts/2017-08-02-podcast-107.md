# The Podcast #107 - Simplify Everything

This week on [The Podcast][p] we continue our discussion on habits - this time giving you simple tips and tricks how to simplify our systems and ways we work and live. How (and what) to question in order to find more margin and space for our creative time:

## Heuristics to use when simplifying:

  * Is this (still) important? Do I care about the goal it's serving?
  * Is it still relevant? Can I do just fine without it?
  * Is it realistic I'll ever get this done?
  * If I'll ever need this again, will I just remember it? (Do I need to store it?)
  * Do I already have it somewhere else? Don't duplicate things.
  * It is the right place for this? (events in calendar, tasks in Nozbe, etc...)
  * Is it the right time for this? (maybe different time of day or day of week would work better?)
  * Can I do it less often?
  * Can I batch it with similar tasks?
  * Can I automate this?
  * Can I delegate it to someone else?
  * Do I actually follow this reminder? (If not, why pretend?)
  * Does this piece of data actually influence my behavior or decisions? (If not, why track it?)
