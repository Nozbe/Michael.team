# How I learned JavaScript by studying source code of Basecamp... and how I keep learning programming by studying code written by others...

Recently [DHH of Basecamp wrote on their blog](https://m.signalvnoise.com/paying-tribute-to-the-web-with-view-source/) about the importance of being able to view the source code and learn from it. I totally agree with that... and in the spirit of [12 years of Nozbe and the last episode of The Podcast](/thepodcast-174) I’d like to share here a story how I actually learned JavaScript by studying their source code years ago. Here goes:

## I built the first version of Nozbe in 2005... with no JavaScript

I built [Nozbe][n] because I needed to get organized. So after reading *Getting Things Done by David Allen* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143126563?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01B6WSMHI?tag=sliwinski-20)) I built a quick tool to get organized over a weekend. It was a very simple web application, but the problem was, when I marked a task as done, I’d have to “save” the page and reload it. Yes, that’s how basic it was... but luckily I was the only user...

## Enter Backpack, a tool by 37signals (now Basecamp)

A few months later I came across [Backpack](http://backpackit.com), a tool that the crew behind [Basecamp](http://Basecamp.com) built. I signed up for it and I fell in love with its simplicity and most of all, I was amazed that the pages there didn’t reload. I marked a task as “done” and it instantly became “done”. I loved it. They were using this new technology which in 2005 was called [“AJAX”.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))

While I loved the Backpack I still preferred my own tool because it was structured a little differently and more focused on “getting things done”... so I started viewing the source code of Backpack and learning from it. This is how I learned the basics of AJAX, JavaScript (with [Prototype.js](http://prototypejs.org)) and much more.

## Thanks to “viewing source code” I could learn based on real-life examples!

I kept studying Backpack’s code and kept improving my app based on what I’ve learned. 

Then I re-wrote my app completely and finally on February 1, 2007 I launched Nozbe to the world - with modern JavaScript and all - and the rest is history.

[3 years later I visited 37signals/Backpack’s offices](https://sliwinski.com/jason-fried-of-37signals-interviewed-for-productive-magazine-8/) to pay homage to their founders and thank Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson and Sam Stephenson for helping me learn to code and inspire me to launch my own business.

## P.S. I’m still learning to code every now and then by studying other people’s code.

Recently I was working on a few updates to our [Nozbe.com web site’s pricing page](https://nozbe.com/pricing) and I was working with our main designer Radek on it. For the context: our marketing page is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is written in programming [language called Go](https://golang.org). I’ve never ever written a line of Go in my life and I wasn’t paying much attention when we migrated our main Nozbe site to Hugo.

To learn I just studied the source code of our web page for a few hours and browsed through the latest commits made by Radek and our CTO to the site. This way when the time came to get my hands dirty, I had a fairly good idea how things worked and how to get stuff done in Hugo and Go. And my designer was impressed. Turns out studying other people’s code is a very good way to learn programming. And even though I’m a CEO now and I don’t get to code as much, my skills and old tricks are still kicking!

So yes, David was right all along - it’s great to share the source code and have others learn from it!
