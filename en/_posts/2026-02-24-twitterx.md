# Even John Oliver is quitting… Twitter

My favorite [British comic](/fuckeu), the host of [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://youtube.com/@LastWeekTonight) is back and I love it how he analyzed why [not only me](/twitter) but also him:

## Notable quotes from John:

> Our main story tonight concerns Twitter…\\
> Or as it's been called since Elon Musk purchased it years ago… Twitter 🤪

He summarized "content creators payouts program" as this:

> There's an ecosystem of people both here and abroad who've discovered you can make money off of pissed Americans staring at their phones…

[Elon Musk](/elon/) manipulating Twitter?

> When Fortune conducted an experiment to gage how prevalent was on Twitter, they set up a dozen of Twitter test accounts and in approximately 90% of the sessions… post from Elon Musk appeared at least once in the timeline, usually much more often. Even clicking "not interested in Elon Musk" didn't change anything. After one test account did that, posts from him more than doubled!

About Minnesota:

> I don't think it's a stretch to say that a lot of the shit you saw in Minnesota was caused at least in part by this fucking tweet [by Nick Shirley - a YouTuber alleging daycare fraud in Minnesota - which was totally false].

About the right-wing march in England and Elon's appearance there:

> Saying "fight back or die" to that crowd, is so malevolent that I can barely wrap my head around it. (…) what he's doing there seems like a strong case of, if I may quote Elon himself, someone whispering terrible things, things that weren't true, and they're pushing a nihilistic and anti-civilizational mind virus to the world…

John's advice:

> My personal advice is not to post on there at all.
