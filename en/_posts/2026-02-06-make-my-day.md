# Every single positive comment counts!

😍 Every. Positive. Comment. Counts! When you’re a business owner, even with thousands of customers, every time I get a positive comment from a client, IT MAKES MY DAY.

Just like this one I got the other day:

> “I just wanted to report that Nozbe won another showdown—this time against Todoist (previously against Asana). Admittedly, that app has its advantages—for me, primarily the kanban column layout (that’s actually the only major thing I miss in Nozbe). But after testing, I’m absolutely sticking with our app, which is faster and very user-friendly.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’m telling you, after 19 years of running my app this never gets old. This always makes my day when someone realizes that thanks to our app they can get THEIR GOALS done.

So if you’re hesitating if you should send me a positive comment… hesitate no more.

Just send it over to me, through direct message or comment below.

It will make my day.

Every time.
