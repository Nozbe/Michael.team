> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We are finishing hiring process for two posts - one programmer and one customer support rep. Can’t wait to start working with new team members!
* We have launched two web sites for solopreneurs, one [in Polish, featuring Marek Jankowski](https://nozbe.com/solo/?c=michaelteam) and one [in English, featuring Jeff Sanders](https://nozbe.com/jeff/?c=michaelteam).
* I’m excited to be working on major redesign to our app’s “side bar” and “task list”. It’s gonna be awesome.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m almost ready to publish the latest [journaling](/journal) [shortcut](/shortcuts), version 4.0 - I’m finishing testing it!
* I’m really happy with my redesigned [home office 2025](/office25) and the [recording studio](/studio).
* I’m now regularly co-hosting Poland’s leading tech podcast - [Nadgryzieni](/pl/nadgryzieni)

## …and privately:

* The trip to the USA was awesome on so many levels. Haven’t been there in years. Will not be re-visiting soon, I’m afraid.
* I love my new [Peak Design ZIP backpack](/zip). So much so, that I got another one with a different color.
* Just celebrated 20th wedding anniversary with my wife. Do people live that long?…
