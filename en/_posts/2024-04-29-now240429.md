# On April 29 I am…

First quarter of 2024 is done. Lots of new things happened at [Nozbe][n] and in my life… good progress all around!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We celebrated [17 years](/nozbe17) of [Nozbe][n] by narrowing down our target audience to [SMART business owners](/smart) - and we launched new web site to celebrate this!
* I hosted an updated [Nozbe 10-steps webinar](/10steps-webinar)
* Last week we have decided NOT to grant people a free trial of Nozbe but give them a free month instead - [there’s a big difference](https://nozbe.com/free?c=michaelteam)

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I published more [Shortcuts](/shortcuts) like [rolling the dice](/dice-shortcut) or [WatchNotes](/watchnotes) for my Apple Watch [Ultra](/ultra)
* I launched a [new YouTube Channel **@MichaelTeam**](/channel) where I’m publishing mainly shorts, but also a new video of [two Michaels arguing about meetings](/meetings)
* I visited [Taiwan](/taiwan) and published some cool content from there. I’m really impressed by this country!

## …and privately:

* I upgraded my [Backpack for 2024](/backpack24) and [our old Macs](/oldmac)
* I published a birthday post [of our family car](/q7)
* I got [reading glasses](/glasses)
* I just spent a weekend hiking with my buddies in Polish mountains (see picture above!)
