# Live demo walkthrough of Nozbe Teams - how to do GTD in teams?

On my last [webinar about working differently](/differently/) I did something crazy and performed a live demo of [Nozbe Teams][n] and turns out it went pretty great. It’s only 20 minutes and it shows clearly how easy it is to invite people to a team, create projects, add tasks and delegate them, and just make sure you know what’s going on in your team. Check it out:

Remember, [Nozbe Teams][n] is free for up to 5 people and 5 active projects, and you can get unlimited projects starting from 3 people for only $19 per month. Isn’t that dirt cheap of a price to pay to get your team on the same page and keep everything organized and much more actionable?
