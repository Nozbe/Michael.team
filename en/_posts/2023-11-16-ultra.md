# Why a small-wrist guy switched to Apple Watch Ultra?

I've been using [Apple Watch](/applewatch/) since the [very beginning](/watch-5days/) but because I'm not tall and I don't have large wrists, I always stuck with the smaller model. Until now. I just bought an **Apple Watch Ultra 2** and despite its size it's the best Apple Watch to date. It's beautiful, it's joy to use and most of all, finally it has the battery life a smartwatch should have:

## ‚åöÔ∏è Switching to the Ultra (49mm) size from a small (41mm) Series 7

Ever since the Apple Watch Ultra debuted last year, I was tempted to try it. As a person who runs [triathlons using Apple Watch](/tri15), this new sports-oriented watch was clearly meant for me. But I had big issue with its size.

However, testing it side-by-side, I wasn't that outraged. It didn't look that ridiculous. I actually liked it on my wrist. Or maybe it was just confirmation bias in action as I really wanted the Ultra? Here's the comparison:

At the end of the day, what made me buy it was that my two-year old *Series 7* had only 80% of its original battery capacity and very often it wouldn't last me until the end of the day. Or worse yet, it'd die while I was doing sports. So when Apple announced its second revision of the Ultra form factor, I went ahead and ordered it.

## üîã Battery life in Apple Watch Ultra 2 is no joke - it's not an issue anymore!

After more than a month of using the Apple Watch Ultra I have a theory that it's the ONLY watch in Apple's lineup that has battery life as it should be. The "all day battery life" on the other watches is a scam. Seriously.

> I never worry about the battery life on the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Ever.

I even sleep with it. I only charge it after a training when I'm in the shower and that's enough. It usually goes from whatever it had to around 70-90% and that's good enough for me. I have no anxiety with 80% of charge because I know it's gonna last me for more than 24 hours with a workout in between.

I don't have to fiddle with settings [like I did on previous Apple Watches](/tri15) when I go on a long bike ride. Last week I did a full-day 100km bike ride with 2000m of elevation gain and after all this the watch still had 40% of juice and I had all the wifi/cellular/screen on all the time in workout mode.

## The "Action button" is very useful!

Initially I set it up to start a workout but later I created my own [Siri Shortcut](/shortcuts/) to use with it so that I can choose from my most used workouts easily. It's amazing that finally we get a truly customizable button on the Apple Watch!

## Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly beautiful with an amazing screen!

I love the design. It's new. It's different from the other Apple Watches and the screen is just amazing. I feel like I want to do more with it. I want to use the Apple Watch more - so I'm starting to build additional Siri Shortcuts for it. [I'm even reading bible on the watch!](/pl/czytanie/)

## Thanks to people who also pushed me to try the Ultra!

My friend [≈Åukasz from iMad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-banaszak-77464423a) and YouTuber iJustine are also people with small wrists and seeing how they embraced the Apple Watch Ultra lifestyle also motivated me to give it a try, so thank you üôè
