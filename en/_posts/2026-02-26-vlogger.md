# Instead of organizing an all-hands-meeting, start vlogging!

Tempted to call a whole-team meeting? DON'T DO IT! Become a vlogger instead. Not on YouTube or TikTok. Not for the public. For your all-team audience. My beloved 15 subscribers.

## I record vlogs for my team

🎬 For years, at Nozbe, I’ve been recording short internal video updates instead of calling meetings or writing long explanations.

Some things are just easier to *say* than to write.

😍 Tone. Context. Nuance. Intent.

These vlogs are not polished. No studio. No script. No fancy setup. Usually just me, my office recording set, and whatever decision or thought needs explaining.

## Internal vlogs help me:

* explain *why* decisions are made, not just *what* was decided
* reduce meetings while increasing clarity
* communicate asynchronously, across time zones

People can watch them when it fits their day. Pause. Rewatch. Skip parts. No pressure to “be present” at a specific hour.

## My vlogs are 10 minutes tops usually…

This works especially well in a remote-first company. Written communication is great — we document a lot. But video adds something documentation can’t: **human signal**.

You see facial expressions. You hear hesitation or excitement. You understand priorities faster.

So yes — inside Nozbe, I’m probably the most recognizable vlogger there is 😅 Not because I like recording myself… but because it’s one of the most effective leadership tools I’ve found in 19 years of remote work.

Work isn’t about being in the same room.

It’s about sharing context in the right format.

❓How does it work in your team — do you ever consider internal vlogs instead of another meeting?
