# Setting up your Apple Watch for the first time - tips and tricks

As I wrote a while ago [I'm really happy with my new Apple Watch][A]. It's actually been a while since I set it up for the first time and I've been tweaking the setup ever since so today I decided to share with you my tips and tricks. Hope you'll find them useful:

Tip 1: **Wear your Apple Watch upside down. Seriously**. When you unpack your Apple Watch and put it on the wrist, the default way is having digital crown on the right side of the Apple Watch. Well, [this setting can be changed and it's actually more natural to use the digital crown with a thumb](http://furbo.org/2015/05/22/apple-watch-ergonomics/). Just go to your Apple Watch app on the iPhone and go to Settings and Watch orientation and change to "digital crown on the left side". I've set this a few weeks ago and I love it. 

Tip 2: **Make the current app your main Watch-face**. Let me explain: you pull out the Apple Watch and open an app, after a few moments with it you stop using the watch, it goes dark, now you pull out the watch again and you see your watch-face, and not the app you've been using before. That's the default behavior. I prefer to see the app again. This way I can open my [Nozbe for watch app](http://Nozbe.watch) and have my priority list of tasks open every time I pull out the watch. This way my [Nozbe][n] app becomes my watch-face. Go to "general", "activate on wrist rise" and choose "resume previous activity".

Tip 3: **Disable notifications gradually... on both the iPhone and the Watch**. [I wrote about notifications before](https://sliwinski.com/notifications). When I got my Apple Watch I wanted to really disable notifications on it right away. Only to leave the most needed ones. In the end I just didn't do anything and let all the notifications arrive to my Apple Watch. When I saw a notification on my watch that I didn't want to receive, I'd think twice and usually also disable it on my iPhone. Now, after a few weeks I've greatly reduced the number of notifications I receive on both devices. Sweet.

Note that you can set up your notifications in iPhone's settings app and in the Apple Watch app on the iPhone separately.
