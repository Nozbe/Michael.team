# #iPadOnly book show - interview with my co-author: Augusto Pinaud - Productive Show #54

Today it's a special show where I am talking to Augusto Pinaud, my co-author of the #iPadOnly book:[iPadOnly.com](https://ipadonly.com) - We're sharing our thoughts explaining why and how you can be more productive on the iPad and why we've been working mostly on our iPads the past years. And how you can join the revolution as well!
