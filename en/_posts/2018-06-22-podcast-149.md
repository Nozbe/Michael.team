# The Podcast #149 - Profit First

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss about THE WAY to handle money - how to save, spend and manage money both in business and personal life in order to have a little more control over what comes in and most of all... what goes out. Inspired by the book ”Profit First” by Mike Michalowicz ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0981808298?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B06X15WX5B?tag=sliwinski-20)):
