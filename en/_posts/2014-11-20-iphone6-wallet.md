# Do-It-Yourself iPhone 6 Plus Wallet - Productive! Show #85


Separate wallet and an iPhone is such an old concept. Now with Apple Pay even more so. That's why after I got an iPhone 6 Plus I decided to create my own wallet for it. I wanted to fit at least 4 cards and some cash. Before this I used to have an iPhone 5S with Quirky Crossover cover... but now that they're not going to produce any of these, I decided to go DIY way - so there you go, here's how you can create a DO IT YOURSELF iPhone 6 Wallet out of a simple iLUV sillicone case with nail scissors. Question: *Do you carry a separate wallet? Would you want to build one of these?*
