# GoPro story - a decade-long "overnight" success

Never heard of the GoPro cameras but now I'm inclined to get one and use it for skiing :-) Again, only this guy knows how much sweat and tears contribute to a success.

## Outside funding needed?

GoPro must have stayed below the press radar for long and I guess now when they got an investment from Foxconn the press got interested.

Does it mean that if you get no outside funding you get no press interest and can stay below the radar for a longer period of time?

## There's no such thing as an "overnight" success

Anyway, it takes lots of years to get to an "overnight" success moment... and even then, the journey is till the reward. That's why I'm so excited about this seventh year of running [Nozbe][n].
