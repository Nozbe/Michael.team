# Chat about Remag - Productive! Show #89

We're back with Augusto talking about Michael's new project - Remag. How it's re-defining the mobile digital publishing. How Michael believes that this is the way to go for the blogs of the future - to create their apps and stay "in touch" (pun intended) with their readers on their mobile devices. On being on their home screens and pushing the content to them. On giving your fans an easy way to subscribe to your content. We talk all about it and some more!
