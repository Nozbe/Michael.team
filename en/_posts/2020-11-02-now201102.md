## Working on [Nozbe][n]

* I’m leading new marketing plan based on our [17 commandments of work](/17/)
* I just introduced a new entry-level [Nozbe Teams][n] plan for only 3 users and unlimited projects at only $19 per month
* I’m going to record more practical videos, just like I did the [video walkthrough of Nozbe Teams](/demo/)

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m updating this blog, imported content from 2019 from my old blog and wrote a [best of 2019 post](/2019best/)
* I’m getting back to writing [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) after 2 months of leaving it be. Need to make time to finish it now!

## …and privately

* I’ve just completed my 12th Olympic-distance triathlon which was a very special one (more on that later)
* I’m witnessing the world of politics both in the US and in Poland taking a really deep dive. I’m hoping it will change for the better!
* I’m anxious about the virus again, seems like we’re facing a new lockdown soon!
* Taking good care of my family: Ewelina, my wife of 15 years and my 3 daughters: Milena (11), Emilia (8) and Liliana (4)
