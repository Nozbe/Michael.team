# STOP working on day-to-day stuff on a Friday. Make it a Mighty Friday!

Seriously. Just STOP üõë. Work on day-to-day stuff from Monday to Thursday and on Friday make it a [#MightyFriday (formerly known as TGIF)](/tgif). You need this Friday as a space to think, plan, review and focus on yourself. Your own personal development. Just follow these 3 steps:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1. Do your [weekly review](/weekly-review/)

Go through your projects, calendar, review your tasks in [Nozbe][n] (or any task and project manager you‚Äôre using‚Ä¶ which should really be Nozbe at this point, right? üòú)

Plan your next week. This way you show up on Monday with a plan and will be productive from day one next week!

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2. Focus on your personal development

Start a side project. Learn something new. Develop your skills. Watch this saved-for-later course online. View replay of this webinar you saved.

Take the time to focus on your skills. Don‚Äôt touch day-to-day stuff. Monday will be for that.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3. If you‚Äôre a manager or CEO, let others do that, too!

Don‚Äôt keep the good things to yourself! What‚Äôs wrong with you? üòú Tell your team to focus on their personal development on a Friday. Not just mention it in passing, actively encourage them!

It will take time. People don‚Äôt really want to slack off and they will want to work on day-to-day stuff. Ask them for their personal development projects. Show off yours. Keep reminding them that Friday is FOR THEM.

As an example, I work on my [michael.team web site](/blogging/) on Fridays. I learn new JS skills, watch conferences online, etc.

## PS. We‚Äôve been doing this [for the last 6 years (since 2016!) in Nozbe](/tgif).

Yep, SIX YEARS. The entire tech stack behind the new Nozbe app has been developed by some of our developers on a Friday as a fun project to try something new. Many of my new ideas for #NoOffice work have been created on a Friday.

## PPS. Find your Weekly Review spot!

Yes, I took this photo TODAY. I went out and found a perfect spot for my weekly review today. Now that‚Äôs an #office, right?
