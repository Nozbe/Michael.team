# Tinkering, building, crafting… and cables in my home office

I love tinkering. Manual crafts always attracted me. I love building [lego blocks](/yoda) and I definitely have enjoyed changing and [re-designing my home offices](/office) many times over the years. Just look at the details of my [current one](/myoffice). And yet, I'm about to improve it even more!

## Casey Neistat's epic NY office

Casey is a [famous YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) who now lives in California, but he rose to fame filming his stuff in New York City, and his office was really dope, here's [another YouTuber, MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/mkbhd), visiting him:

What I love about his office:

- build over buy - he builds most of the stuff he uses
- cables on the outside - he doesn't hide the cables, these are clearly visible so he can trace them to where they go
- everything labeled - he's using sharpies everywhere to label everything - this way he doesn't have to think what is what.
- single-purpose places - a special desk to work, to shoot, to edit, to tinker…
- everything is exactly adjusted to the way he works - it's all custom to him.

If the above video wasn't enough, here's another one he posted:

## Inspired by Casey I'm building stuff up again!

After a year in my new home office I'm doing some changes again. I've got some plans for this Friday to make my office even better:

### Dedicated place to shoot live shows, webinars and official zoom meetings

I want to dedicate a corner of my home office as a "stage" for my official video calls, podcast and live show recordings. So that I just step in there, and basically with one or two clicks I'm set and ready.

For that I'm installing the green screen, getting a better web cam, setting up lights differently, changing location of the second monitor, and more.

### One more OSB wooden wall

I'm installing two more [OSB boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriented_strand_board) which I love. Right in the corner where the recording studio will be. This wall will help me mount required equipment easier and gives me additional *wooden feel* as a bonus.

### Small improvements to cable management

I've changed quite a few accessories since last year. I embraced the [MagSafe lifestyle](/magsafe) and re-examined the [contents of my backpack](/backpack) so now it's time to get my cables and other home office gadgets in order.

While doing that I'm planning to simplify the cable management, stop hiding the cables Casey-style and label many more things than before.

## Tinkering is my vice and my perfect hobby

I like building things. I love tinkering. While watching cartoons with my daughters, my favorite character has always been [Tinker Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell) for a reason. Because she could build stuff out of anything.

Tinkering is also a perfect way for me to stop using my computer and just put a good use to hammer, nails and drills.  As discussed [in the episode 196 of The Podcast](/podcast-196/) - it's very rewarding, exciting and kinda addictive.

Here's to my home office renovation ad 2021!
