> Note: this is my monthly ["now page"](/now) update where I share with you what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Excited to see my team again *in person* as we‚Äôre all [vaccinated](/vaccine) - I‚Äôm thankful we can see each other, enjoy our time together and [help Ukrainian refugees](/nowar/)
* Promoting the idea of [Mighty Friday](https://nozbe.com/friday) which was born back in 2016 as [TGIF](/tgif/)
* Working on [new Nozbe features](/nozbe15/) now that we celebrated our 15th anniversary and renamed ‚ÄúNozbe Teams‚Äù to simply ‚Äúnew Nozbe‚Äù.

## ‚Ä¶and when I can, I'm also:

* Preparing the launch of the [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) - it‚Äôll start in April with the official book launch in June
* Improving my home office yet again by adding an M1 MacBook Air as the new Mac to the mix.
* Writing here on this blog - [about Ukraine](/nowar/), [privilege](/white/) and [inaction](/nothing/). I‚Äôm on a roll recently with my writing!

## ‚Ä¶and privately:

* Training for another olympic-distance triathlon which is happening in May
* Helping my parents and my friends in Poland to coordinate Ukrainian relief efforts
* Getting many official papers organized (will, LTD, backups‚Ä¶)
