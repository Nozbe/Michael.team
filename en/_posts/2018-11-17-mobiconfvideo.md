# Which mobile apps we use to run our Nozbe company? - video of my presentation at Mobiconf 2018

Last month I was kindly invited to one of the biggest mobile conferences in Europe - [Mobiconf 2018](https://2018.mobiconf.org/speakers/) and I had a chance to do a follow up to my [Infoshare 2018](/infoshare/) presentation on the way we work. Today it's Saturday so if you want to get inspired how to work better next week, make sure to check it out:

## My presentation at Mobiconf was about the [apps](https://sliwinski.com/apps) we use to do our [#NoOffice](/tag/nooffice) work and the way we communicate- specifically our [pyramid of communication](https://sliwinski.com/pyramid)

Enjoy, and if you'd like to also get my book on “NoOffice apps” make sure to sign up to my newsletter below this post.

It was also nice that some people who were at my presentation rally liked it. So much so that [I won an award for the best presentation](https://twitter.com/MSliwinski/status/1060864448947216384) on the “everything mobile” track, neat! If you liked it, too, make sure to let me know!
