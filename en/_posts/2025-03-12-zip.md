# Is Peak Design Everyday Zip 15L an ideal small backpack for airplanes?

In Europe, most airlines, especially Ryanair, Easyjet and Wizzair, let you have a **free small bag** which you can put under a seat. The dimensions are more-less 40cm of height (16 inches), 25-30cm of width (10-12 inches) and 20cm of bulk (8 inches). Most of my [backpacks](backpack/#other-backpacks-ive-used-and-tested) are between 20-26L and they are just too big. Normally I'd get away with it, but recently the airlines started paying more attention to these bags' sizes. So I checked if my favorite bag/pouches company Peak Design had anything that would work and I think I found it. It's [Everyday Backpack Zip 15L](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?Size=15L) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/41EWMqC)).

## Small but a very practical backpack

As most things from Peak Design, the backpack is very well made, very well thought out and surprisingly capable. Its height is only 2cm more than the officially allowed size (42 vs 40 cm) but I heard from the people that it still fits the airlines' *measure box*. The rest of the dimensions are perfect.

In the past I was reluctant to getting one of these bags because they're mainly tailored at photographers and I don't identify as one and I don't carry my DSLR or lenses with me all that often. However, thanks to this positioning it has these great zippers that let you open it all the way and have size access to the bag which turns out is pretty handy.

It also features a separate laptop compartment which can be accessed from the outside (which I love!) and it just fits my [M4 iPad Pro with Magic Keybaord](/ipadm4). It is tight, but fits my iPad just so. It also features a separate place for documents and a small pocket for gadgets like [AirPods](/airpodspro) or [iPhone](/iphone).

## What can fit in a 15L ZIP Backpack?

I love pouches from Peak Design. I have several of them:

- 1 [Tech Pouch](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch?Size=Regular&Color=Midnight) where I have [all my go-to accessories](/backpack/#whats-in-my-tech-pouch). ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4ikazdl))
- 2 [Small Packing Cubes](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/packing-cube?Size=Small) I use for my clothes and I usually fit all of them for a week in these two. ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4kyJl4h))
- 1 [Ultralight Mesh Packing Cube XXS](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/ultralight-packing-cube?Size=XXS&Color=Eclipse&Material=Mesh) I use for my toiletries. ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4kHqzYs))
- 1 [Ultralight Fabric Packing Cube XS](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/ultralight-packing-cube?Size=XS&Color=Eclipse&Material=Fabric) I keep in case I need to pack some additional things. ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4ho5OOG))
- 1 [Packable Tote](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/packable-tote?Color=Raw) I use for going shopping. ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4kREETg))

Now, I wanted to know how many of them would fit in this backpack. Obviously, not all of them, but what is possible?

### Load 1. Tech Pouch and Packing Cube

My next trip is going to be a weekend trip so for a short trip like this, if I were to take all of my cables and gadgets, I'd put in the Tech Pouch and I'd fit all my changes of clothes (boxers, socks, shirts) in one Packing cube and it fits perfectly:

![{{ page.title }} tech](/img/zip-tech.jpg)

This backpack also features these cool Velcro-based dividers which photographers use. I'm not sure I'll be using them as they are not needed when I have everything packed in cubes.

So it can fit:

- 1 Tech Pouch
- 1 Packing Cube
- 1 XXS Mesh Pouch with toiletries

Perfect for a weekend away.

### Load 2. Two Packing Cubes - more clothes!

Can I fit more clothes in there? Good question! So instead of taking my tech pouch, I decided to put my Anker 2xUSB-C Nano charger and an [Apple Watch](/ultra) USB-C cable and a 3-in-1 USB-C cable in the side pockets of this bag. This way if I don't need any more cables, I can just get away with these to charge all of my devices and I have more space in the backpack. Turns out two Packing Cubes fit just fine:

![{{ page.title }} cubes](/img/zip-cubes.jpg)

The only thing is that the Packing Cubes cannot be loaded 100% in length. So you can stack many clothes but make sure they are not filled up to their full length:

- 2 Packing Cubes with lots of clothes
- 1 XXS Mesh Pouch with toiletries
- Charger and cables in side pockets
- 1 XS Pouch in other side pocket as a spare

Perfect for a longer weekend where I might need more clothes and not too many gadgets.

## Carabiner for practicality and security?

This backpack has many hooks and two straps, the typical Peak Design style. And they made special security hooks on the zippers. However, I still prefer to add a carabiner to be able to hook up all the zips together to keep pickpocketers away.

There is also a hidden pocket on the top of the backpack and they even give you a nice key ring for it. I have my house keys in there and an [AirTag](/airtag) so I never lose my backpack.

## Perfect under-the-seat free backpack for airplanes?

Yes it is. Just tested it on a 4-day trip over a longer weekend and the backpack was ideal for it, it was completely loaded:

![{{ page.title }} loaded](/img/zip-loaded.jpg)

In the main compartment I packed:

- 2 Packing cubes of clothes
- 1 XXS Mesh Pouch with toiletries
- 1 XS Pouch with food/snacks
- Ray Ban Meta glasses

In the side pockets I packed:

- [Anker Charger 523](/anker/#anker-523-47w---lightest-cheapest-and-best-all-around-charger)
- USB-C Apple Watch Charging cable
- USB-C to 3 cable (USB-C, Lightning and micro-USB)
- USB-C to HDMI cable (to connect to screens)
- USB-A to USB-C and USB-C to USB-A adapters (just in case)
- USB pen drive

In the "key" pocket that I mentioned above, I also fit an Anker Power Bank 10K.

A backpack packed like this, fit no problem the airport's "measuring cage":

What I also appreciated about this backpack during this trip were the following features:

- When packed, it stands straight. Doesn't fall over.
- It has vey comfortable straps. I did 20km a day and it was no big deal carrying it around. Of course the shoulder strap really helped as well.
- The fact it opens completely and the zippers that can let me open it from the side and take something out from the bottom of the backpack. Genius.

Unless the airlines change their rules yet again, I think this backpack will be my go-to choice whenever I have to fly on short distances for a few days and will not need too many things.

## How about a brighter color? I got a "Bone" color as well!

Two months after getting this backpack I happened to be on the West Coast of the USA and I decided to take this opportunity and visit the Peak Design's official retail store in LA:

![{{ page.title }} store](/img/zip-store.jpg)

While there, I couldn't help myself and I got the second backpack, just this time in the beige "bone" color and it's so cute! This color wasn't available online when I was getting the backpack so I could only get it in the store.

![{{ page.title }} Death Valley](/img/zip-dv.jpg)

I took the new backpack on the trail and you must admit it looks great on [Death Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley) tracks, right? Blends in perfectly.

## Dividers make a difference, even when you don't have photo gear!

Apparently even if you're not a photographer, the dividers that come with the backpack are very useful, when traveling:

![{{ page.title }} Dividers](/img/zip-dividers.jpg)

Thanks to the side-access mentioned earlier, I learned to appreciate the fact that you can easily divide space in the backpack and access different parts of it easily. My favorite setup was installing one divider on the bottom of the backpack and a power bank right below it, and a second divider much higher. This way I could keep creams and food separate from other things.

## P.S. Video walkthrough of this backpack by Peak Design

This is not a sponsored post, although I will get a ([small commission if you order through Amazon](https://amzn.to/41EWMqC)). I'm just a big fan of Peak Design and their video comparing the ZIP 15L and 20L actually convinced me to give this backpack a try:
