# RIP - Clay Innovation and Kobe Elevation - thank you for your inspiration!

Last week two people I greatly admired died. One of them a sports legend - Kobe Bryant - who was just one year older than me... and the other one - a thought-provoking business legend - the author of the ‚Äúinnovator‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù - Clay Christensen. This short post is my tribute to them.

## [Clay Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen) was a great business inspiration

I saw Clay for the first time on [Business of Software Conference in Boston in 2011 - you can watch his presentation online](https://businessofsoftware.org/2012/02/professor-clayton-christensen-at-business-of-software-2011-the-job-your-product-does/) (photo above taken by me from the audience). This was the first time I heard about the theory of disruption, the "jobs to be done" and the innovator's dilemma. After that I watched many more of his presentations and interviews in the podcasts like [Critical Path](http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/36).

He shaped the way I think about products and also the way I develop [Nozbe][n] and [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/teams). I keep asking myself - [what would Clay ask?](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3225-what-are-questions) What are people using our product, really hiring it to do for them?

## [Kobe Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant) was a basketball legend - 5 time champion with the NBA

I remember when Kobe entered the league and I thought he didn't have enough talent to have a successful career - I thought he was going to become an NBA celebrity and not much more. Especially due to his "Kobe elevation Adidas ads". I was so wrong about him.

He started slow but then he wan the slam dunk contest in 1997:

He won 3-times championships with LA Lakers first... then he scored 81 points in a single game:

And then in his last game ever after 20 years with Lakers, he scored 60 points as his farewell party:

## RIP Clay and Kobe! üôè 

Both died untimely death. Both had so much more go give... but they inspired generations... [they affected many](https://500ish.com/hard-8-8a7702267dda)... and they were and will continue to be important to me.

Thanks Clay and Kobe - and see you in the afterlife!
