# New To Do - official Nozbe Siri Shortcut for iOS and Mac

I've created a version 2.0 of [Nozbe Shortcut to add tasks](/nozbe-add/) recently and it's much more powerful. Here's what it can do:

### [New To Do Shortcut for Nozbe version 2.0][s]

Also available: [üáµüá± Polish version - Nowe Zadanie][sp]

I've named the Shortcut "new to do" because when I say that, Siri actually reacts to my Shortcut. She doesn't like the word *[Nozbe][n]* for some reason‚Ä¶

## Features of "New To Do" for Nozbe

This Shortcut does several things:

1. Adds a task you say to Siri
2. If you have a photo, photos or files in clipboard, it will detect them and attach them to your new task if you want and ask you for optional description.
3. If you have several lines of text selected, it will ask you if you want to add **several tasks at once** and batch add them!

## How to set it up?

Just open [Nozbe][n] and go to Settings > API Tokens and create a new token. Once you've [added the Shortcut][s] it will ask you to paste that token. This is your way of authenticating to Nozbe. Don't share this token with anyone else.

## More on the Nozbe blog:

[Read a longer and more detailed description on the Nozbe blog][nb] where you'll also find better instructions as to how to set it up.
