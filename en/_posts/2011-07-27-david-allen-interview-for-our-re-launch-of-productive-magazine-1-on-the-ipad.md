# David Allen interview for our re-launch of Productive! Magazine #1 on the iPad

Our free [Productive! Magazine iPad app](http://appstore.com/nozbecom/productive) is increasingly popular now and we're trying to port all of our back-issues of the magazine to the iPad. We decided to start with #1 with David Allen, the "father" of GTD (Getting Things Done methodology) and I had a pleasure of talking to David about what has happened since 2008 when we first launched our first issue of the Productive! Magazine. Productive! Magazine iPad app will be updated to accommodate this new issue so we're waiting for Apple approval... should happen sometime next week - once there, we'll publish issue #1 there. Meanwhile enjoy my ~5min. interview with David:
