# MKBHD goes iPadOnly and I really like his way of using the iPad!

Today by accident I saw a video of MKBHD using only iPad as his only “portable computer” and I was really impressed how he was doing it. Here are my takeaways:

* **He doesn't use any cover, not even keyboard folio** which is strange for me as after I got my [first iPad Pro](https://sliwinski.com/babyipad) I always had the keyboard on it. However after watching his video I'm tempted to use the iPad more like this and only use the keyboard folio when I'm really writing a longer piece - like this blog post or my [No Office Book](https://NoOffice.org)
* **He's been using the iPadOS beta** and I have installed it only on my testing device because of the iCloud Drive problems the beta has. Now that beta 6 is out which solved most of these issues I'm tempted to get it, too! Especially the new "small" keyboard with "swiping" is cool on the new iOS. 
* **iPad is just more fun to use!** that's what he says in the video and that's what [I've been preaching all along!](https://sliwinski.com/whichipad)
* **photo editing on the iPad works!** for him and it seems the pro workflows are coming to the iPad.
* **There's a solid learning curve to the iPadOS Shortcuts** so I need to study these, too!
* **iPad is not a computer replacement but a computer alternative** and I think this best encapsulates this video!

I must say I am very happy that more and more people are taking on the "iPad only challenge" and I'm looking forward to the developments on the [iPadOnly front](https://iPadOnly.com) and how his way of working on the iPad influences the way I work...
