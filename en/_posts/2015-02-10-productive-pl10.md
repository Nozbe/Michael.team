# Getting stuff done in Poland: Productive! Magazine PL 10 with Paul Nowak

As a Polish guy I'm really proud of the Polish edition of the [Productive! Magazine][] which in terms of traffic and downloads is approaching quickly the global version. In the last issue I had a pleasure of interviewing a friend and a fellow entrepreneur: Pawe≈Ç Nowak, CEO of [Presspad](http://Presspadapp.com):

[Productive! Magazine Polska no. 10][1]

I was lucky enough to be able to interview Paul in person and have a great chat about entrepreneurship, startups and productivity of a serial founder. Hope you'll enjoy this issue which apart from [reading online][1] you can also enjoy [on your iPhone or iPad][I] or [Android][G]. As always, it's completely free and will inspire you to get things done!

***Question:*** *How do you like the Polish edition of our productivity magazine?*
