# After 10 years, GTD Summit is back!

It’s been 10 years since the “father of GTD”, [David Allen](http://productivemag.com/1/interview-with-david-allen) - the author of the best-selling book *“Getting Things Gone - the art of stress-free productivity”* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143126563?tag=sliwinski-20) or [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01B6WSMHI?tag=sliwinski-20)), organized a conference dedicated to being productive - the [GTD Summit](https://gtdsummit.com). I was there last time ([in 2009 in San Francisco, USA](https://sliwinski.com/meet-the-editor-and-nozbe-20-at-the-gtd-summit-in-san-francisco/)) and I’m here this time (Amsterdam, The Netherlands in Europe) and I can’t wait to meet my fellow over-achievers here.

## Joined by Polish GTD ninja and a GTD coach!

Just like 10 years ago, I’m at this conference with the black belt of Polish GTD folks - my long-time friend: [Krzysztof “TesTeq” Wysocki](http://productivemag.pl/1/wywiad-z-krzysztofem-wysockim), the author of a very popular Polish blog on business productivity: [“Biznes bez stresu”.](https://biznesbezstresu.pl) (Pictured above with me just before the start of the conference). This time I’m also joined with the official Polish GTD coach - a good friend [Jakub Ujejski](http://productivemag.pl/2/wywiad-z-jakubem-ujejskim). I’m in a really great company here!

## I’m still a GTD fan to the core :-)

My original inspiration for designing [Nozbe][n] was the Backpack app by 37signals mixed with 3 basic concepts from Getting Things Done: projects, next actions and contexts... and even though over the years my app evolved into its own system - and now it’s [becoming a “to-do app for teams”](https://Nozbe.com), I’m still a big fan of David’s work and my book [“10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity”](https://productivitycourse.com) is an compilation of my own habits mixed with several productivity systems, including GTD.

That’s why I’m so happy to be here for the next two days and spend time with fellow GTD enthusiasts and learn more from them how to be a better leader, better person and a better productivity guy!

## P.S. Is Amsterdam a city of Hamsters?

Before I came here I told my 7-year old Emilia that *“daddy is going to Amsterdam for a conference”* and she responded with *”say hi 👋 to all the hamsters 🐹 from me!”* and when I made a strange faced she quickly explained: *”you just said you were going to Hamster-dam, right?”*....

Now I cannot un-hear it. **Hamsterdam it is** and I’m happy to be here for this decade-in-the-making meeting of GTD aficionados.
