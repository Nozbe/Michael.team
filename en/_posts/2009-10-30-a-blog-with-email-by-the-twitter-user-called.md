# A blog with email - by the Twitter user called MichaelNozbe

Hello here in the new place. I decided to replace my blog at **www.sliwinski.biz** with this new blog at **posterous.com**.

<!--More-->

![{{ page.title }}](/img/{{ page.img }})

I just like the fact that it's a simple email message and that it works. I don't have to worry about Wordpress updates, tweaks, settings, I just prepare an email, send it and that's it - my new blog post is posted!

Now, my web site at: **michaelnozbe.com** reflects my Twitter handle: **MichaelNozbe**.
