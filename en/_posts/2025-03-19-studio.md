# Perfect Recording Studio in my Home Office 2025

Now that I've finished setting up [My new Home Office for 2025](/office25) I'm starting to appreciate the tweaks and improvements that lead to making it my best "recording studio" ever. It's an improvement to the [Streaming setup from 2021](/streaming) and most gear stayed the same, but with the new things that came in and much better light management this makes the overall result amazing:

## Effortless recording and zoom video conferencing…

I've covered most of the setup in my [detailed overview of the home office including the new Prompter](/office25/#prompter---a-teleprompter-upgrade-i-didnt-know-i-needed) but what it comes down to is making the setup effortless.

Many people are confused that I'm saying I'm [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly) and I still have a [Mac Mini](/office25/#m4-mac-mini---the-new-soul-of-my-home-office) but the explanation is easy. My main computer to work (I'm writing these words on it) is still the [M4 iPad Pro](/ipadm4) but my additional computer that runs my home office is a Mac Mini.

Mac Mini in my [home office](/office) makes everything effortless: [backups to SSD](/ssd) and running the Zoom video conferencing and video and podcast recording. Thanks to the fact that everything is set up correctly, transforming my home office to a semi-professional recording studio is [super easy, barely an inconvenience](/pitch).

Yes, I could potentially also record podcasts and videos on my iPad if I really wanted to, but it would be much more cumbersome and would require many steps of preparation before each recording session. Now, on to my setup.

## My home office looks like this…

We live in a townhouse and my home office is on the third floor. Additionally I have big windows on the right side of me when I work by my desk, so I get lots of daylight which is awesome.

## Recording studio - control your light!

Lots of daylight is great, but not when you want to record something and you need a consistent light everywhere. You want to be able to control the light in spite of the time of day. That's why when I want to record, my home office transforms into a cool studio that looks like this:

## Components of my recording studio…

It's about the lights, the stand-up desk, the blinds on the windows, the microphone and everything else:

Here's my detailed setup:

1. **2 x [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/p/key-light)** ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4iuFXFq)) - one in front of me, one to the side.
2. **Elgato Green Screen MT**, which is no longer available for purchase, but today I'd probably buy the new [Elgato Green Screen XL](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/green-screen-xl) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/41JsLpL)) and put it on the floor instead of installing it on the ceiling.
3. **IKEA smart bulb** right above me to light up the green screen behind me. It makes sure the green on the green screen is consistent behind me and there's almost no shadow.
4. **IKEA Blinds** that completely cut off the studio part of my home office so even an early morning rising sun doesn't disturb me while recording.
5. **[Sony ZV-E10](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10-b)** ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3FsSCug)) with [SIGMA 16mm F1.4 lens](https://www.sigmaphoto.com/16mm-f1-4-dc-dn-c) ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4id1xi3)) connected to my Mac using [Elgato Camlink 4K](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4hiier1)). On the lens I mounted [Elgato Prompter](https://www.elgato.com/p/prompter) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3R0AM4l)) - my [new favorite office gadget](/office25).
6. **[Maidesite stand-up desk](https://www.maidesite.com)** where I have 4 presets: (1) sitting, (2) standing, (3) standing and recording, (4) as high as possible as long as my lamps don't hit the ceiling. With my old trusty [Shure MV7+ microphone](https://amzn.to/4bZcXUB) mounted using [RØDE PSA1](https://rode.com/en/accessories/stands-bars/psa1) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4bJpf39)).
7. **More IKEA smart bulbs** for additional lights, also in the back of the desk and green screen.

## 2 in 1: Home Office and Recording Studio!

Thanks to this setup I can quickly transform my usual home office to a cool recording studio where I can record videos [like the ones on the Nozbe page](https://nozbe.com/guide/?c=michaelteam):

1. One tap to change a **smart scene** in my office where all the IKEA bulbs light up, the Sony camera turns on thanks to a [smart switch](/office25/#prompter---a-teleprompter-upgrade-i-didnt-know-i-needed).
2. One tap to put the **stand-up** desk at a desired position and put the microphone at the right place.
3. One click to turn on **Key Lights**.
4. One gesture to put the **green screen** behind me.
5. Start recording!
