# Productive Magazine issue #3 with Michael Bungay Stanier (August 2009


This time we kept our word and thanks to the common work of the entire Productive Magazine Team we've manage to release this new issue of the magazine this Saturday! Without further ado I'd like to recommend you this summer read of the magazine with a very insightful interview I happened to have a pleasure doing with - Michael Bungay Stanier - Canadian coach of the Year 2006 and one of the most respected coaches worldwide, a "Creative questioner" how David Allen calls him. Apart from the interview we've got great articles by many fantastic bloggers, so I recommend you just dive in and download this magazine right now and send it to your friends:
