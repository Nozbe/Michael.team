# What's in my USA trip tech pouch in 2025?

This week I'm traveling to the USA on business as I've been offered a quite unique opportunity to meet one of my business gurus - [Nathan Barry](https://nathanbarry.com) - and record a podcast with him - [the Nathan Barry Show](https://www.youtube.com/@thenathanbarryshow). It's a quick trip as I'm staying in the US for only 3 nights. And it's a long trek, as I'll be flying close to 20 hours each way. For this trip I decided to pack ultra-light and get only the most necessary tech:

## My tech pouch for a quick trip

My main computers on this trip will be the [M4 iPad Pro](/ipadm4) and [iPhone Air](/air).

![{{ page.title }} list](/img/pouch-small-list.jpg)

1. All the accessories for these two devices are packed neatly in my [Peak Design Mini Tech pouch](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch?Size=Small&Color=Sage)  ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/4rRLvPM)) (the small sibling of my favorite [regular-size Tech Pouch](/pouch/)).
2. Sticky notes are always a good thing to take.
3. For sleeping, I use an eye-cover from EVA air.
4. My favorite [USB-C to HDMI adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V5JK36/?tag=sliwinski-20). Doesn't work with the iPhone Air but I use it with my iPad anyway
5. **Hyperdrive 4-port 100W charger**. This one is perfect for my trip as it can be used both in Europe and USA (by just taking off the European adapter).
6. [INIU 3-in-1 charger](https://amzn.to/4iUfnHo), the best according to [MobileReviewsEH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGzUzX5k9YM)
7. [Moft MagSafe wallet and tripod](https://amzn.to/4q0f0gy)
8. Passport
9. Cash (a few US dollars) in a cash-looking wallet which I got from my [late uncle](/uncle).
10. [U-green USB-A to USB-C adapters](https://amzn.to/3YjRcbI)
11. **Hyperdrive USB-C hub** for my iPad
12. Magnetic USB-C cables from
13. Nike Apple Watch Sports band (as an alternative to the one I'm currently wearing)
14. [U-green USB-C to audio](https://amzn.to/48NVJbp) converter
15. Lavalier Microphone in case I want to record something on the go (not sure I need it really…)
16. [AirFly Pro](https://amzn.to/3MwBGqv) adapter (not pictured above, sorry!) so I can connect to the entertainment system on the plane.

## Headphones for the trip

I'm taking two of them:

- **Bose QC-35 headphones** - I've had them for almost a decade now - they still work great and are prefect for long airplane flights. [Maybe I should get the newer ones?](https://amzn.to/44kIptE)
- [AirPods Pro 3](/airpods) - always have them in my pocket.

## Backpack is the Peak Design ZIP

And I'm packing everything in my favorite [Peak Design ZIP backpack](/zip), where I also carry:

- [Anker 20K 100W Power bank](https://amzn.to/4pwLzmw) with a 3-in-1 USB-C to USB-C/Micro-USB/Lightning cable. This thing is awesome - it takes 100W as well to re-charge, so it's full in a little over an hour.
- [Kindle](/kindle) - I want to keep cultivating my reading habit.

## Let's travel to the USA!

Yeah I know, maybe I've still taken too many things, but I'd like to have my bases covered and I'm happy that I've comfortably fit everything in the small Tech Pouch.
