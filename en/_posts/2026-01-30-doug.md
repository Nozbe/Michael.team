# What’s next for Doug DeMuro? This!… More of this!

Exactly 10 years ago [I wrote a blog post](/next) saying, that when people ask me after my success with Nozbe, what’s next for me - I answer - more of Nozbe - next version of Nozbe!

{% include video.html id=page.vid %}

<!--More-->

## 🤓 And it gets me (and Doug) excited!

Now I was watching Doug DeMuro’s video where he was sharing what’s next for him - and his answer was just like mine - more of THIS.

[Doug DeMuro](https://www.youtube.com/@DougDeMuro) is my favorite car YouTuber - he has 5+ million subscribers on his channel and he’s created this car auctioning site called [“Cars and Bids”](https://carsandbids.com). Three years ago he sold the majority of that site to a bigger firm and cashed out with some of that money, but he still runs that site.

And he still wants to run it and his investors apparently also want him to run it.

I just love this kind of attitude. Just like me, after 19 years of Nozbe, I want more of THIS! Next version of Nozbe. I feel like we’re just getting started.

## 😍 If you love what you do… you'll never work in your life!

Doug basically says it in his video.

> I've been doing car reviews for the last 9 years on my Channel and I still love doing it and I still get excited about each car I'm going to review.

When people ask him about his plans, he's like:

> Why "next"? I don't want "next"! I like "now". This is what I like!

I can't stress that enough. He goes even deeper which to me personally is all that it's about:

> The real reason why I stick around and why I keep doing this… (…) is **this is just the best damn job I've ever had.** And to me… this is the best job I could ever imagine having. (…) I literally can't imagine doing anything else. **I don't want to do anything else.**

And then he tops it off with a great comment on work-life balance:

> I get a lot of time with my family, and my kids and my community, which is my number one the most important thing. And I also get to spend time at work doing what I love, when kids are at school. (…) And I see no reason why stop doing that when I have a pretty good balance in my schedule between my personal time and work.

I encourage you to check his video and listen to him explain, why when you've discovered what you want to do in your life, you don't want to be doing anything else.

This is totally how I feel after 19 years of running [Nozbe][n].
