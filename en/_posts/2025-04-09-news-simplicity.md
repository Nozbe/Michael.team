## ☑️ Simplicity isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s a strategic choice

Keeping things simple is the goal. Productivity ≠ doing more & faster. Actually, productivity = doing less, but better. More intentionally. Be aware of *what* you want to do and *focus* on it.

## 🤝 Essentialism and simplicity - trade-offs are real

You can't do everything, and trying to will leave you burned out and ineffective. Essentialism means saying yes to to what is truly important and hell-yeah-worthy.

## 🤷🏼 Sorry, but you can’t have it all

When you try to do too many things at once, your brain pays the price. Multitasking makes you more distracted, tired… and less effective. Research shows that switching tasks can reduce productivity by up to 40%. Forty!

## 🔥 Focus is your superpower

Constant distractions and multitasking destroy your ability to do meaningful work so focus on the single most important task that moves the needle. But you don’t fall into focus by accident. Help yourself with rituals, routines and time blocks.

## 🚧 Barrier to entry must be low

Whether it’s starting a run, going on a diet, or writing a report — the first step should be frictionless. Complexity and lack of preparation gives your brain room to make excuses.
Simplicity gets you moving before doubt creeps in.
