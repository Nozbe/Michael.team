# Interview with Jeff Sanders - Productivity for Podcasters - Productive! Show

As you know, I'm a [regular podcaster these days](/show). I've been publishing [video interviews](/interviews) for a while now, but after [more than 70 episodes of The Podcast](/podcast) and more than 7000 weekly listeners, I'm all about podcasting! And if you listen to podcasts, you might know my good friend [Jeff Sanders](/jeff-sanders) whom [I interviewed for the episode #102](/jeff). He had me on his show, [5AM Miracle Podcast - episode 178](https://www.jeffsanders.com/ten-steps-to-ultimate-productivity-with-michael-sliwinski-podcast-178/) over a month ago, so I decided to publish my chat with him, which originally appeared on the [Nozbe blog][b], where he shares his productivity tips for podcasters:
