# Life finds a way… to USB-C with adapters for Braun and Phillips…

Turns out in technology, if you dig deep enough, life… uh… finds a way as Jeff Goldblum would say. After my [USB-C all gifts](/usbc25) post I got lots of cool suggestions for more USB-C powered gadgets, but I also inspired people to search for solutions to their old appliances. One of my good friends, determined to keep using his Phillips shaver, [found an adapter that converts their proprietary charger to USB-C](https://amzn.to/4pvipV8) and right after, [he sent me one for Braun](https://amzn.to/48XmwmI):

## Adapters to the rescue!

When I got my friend's messages I was like - why didn't I think about it? Of course there would be some solutions to this! Turns out he was right and I insta-bought an adapter for my Braun appliances and this adapter works with both my *Series 9 Shaver* and *[Beard Trimmer](/beard)*.

Now I know. Next time when I want to charge an appliance, let's check the Internet and find one!

## Old-school companies, please just embrace USB-C

Instead of getting such adapters, I'd rather prefer dropping the old chargers by the old guard of old companies.

However, until that happens, with this one adapter I can charge both - my shaver and my trimmer.

I just checked. It works great:

## Have you found any other interesting USB-C adapters?

Please do let me know.
