# No Office FM #85: From Chaos to Clarity â€“ 10 Books That Changed My Life

In a world that rewards busyness over progress, these 10 books taught me how to slow down, focus better, and create more with less. From the micro improvements of Atomic Habits to the deep focus of Deep Work, from the clarity of Essentialism and The One Thing to the structure of Getting Things Done and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People â€” these ideas reshaped how I think, work, and live. Better yet, these books are helping me design my app â€“ Nozbe â€“ that thousands of smart business owners use to get their professional and private life organized.
