# Books I'm excited about: Living Forward, The Coaching Habit, 5 AM Miracle and How To Be Really Productive

Recently a few great books launched by people I truly admire and the best part - I was lucky enough to personally get to know all of them! That's why, if you're in doubt, pick up any of the following books and you'll be inspired to improve your life - I'm in the process of reading all of them and so far I'm hooked. Here goes:

## [Living Forward][hyatt] by [Michael Hyatt][hyatt2]

*...the proven plan to stop drifting and get the life you want.* 

Michael is my friend, mentor and role model. Can't recommend his work enough. He knows a thing or two about "big picture thinking" so I'm sure he'll teach us all how to design and execute our lives. The book launched today!

## [The Coaching Habit][bungay] by [Michael Bungay Stanier][bungay2]

*...say less, ask more and change the way you lead forever*

This Michael (wow, these guys have really great names, right?) taught me a lot about distinguishing between "good work" and "great work". Now he'll help me lead with greatness. This book launched yesterday. 

## [The 5AM Miracle][5am] by [Jeff Sanders][5am2]

*...dominate your day before breakfast*

Jeff is the "morning person" guy. He's a productivity nut like me and I love his passion for making each day "on purpose". This is what he'll teach you in this very practical and actionable book. It was published in December of last year. 

## [How to be REALLY productive][really] by [Grace Marshall][really2]

*... achieving clarity and getting results in a world where work never ends*

Grace is an amazing productivity coach and she's got lots of experience getting people organized. And she's just a great person. If your time management skills are a mess, I'd start with her book!

***Question:*** *Which books do you recommend?*
