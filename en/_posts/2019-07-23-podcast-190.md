# The Podcast #190 - Webmaster is back!

Recently on [The Podcast][p] I explained how I became “the webmaster” and launched not 1, not 2 but 3 web site projects. One for my children’s parents association, one for Nozbe team internally and new, Medium-free [NoOffice.org](https://nooffice.org). And we decided to take a break from podcasting for the summer. Watch this short teaser and listen to this episode below:
