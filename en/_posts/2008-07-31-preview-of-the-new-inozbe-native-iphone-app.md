# Preview of the new iNozbe - native iPhone app

Today I've [announced on the Nozbe blog](http://www.nozbe.com/gtd/blog/post-84d9c7/%5Bpreview%5D_inozbe_for_the_appstore_coming_soon_to_your_iphone) that we're currently working on the native [iNozbe](http://www.inozbe.com) for the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone).

There are many challanges with the project: 

  * Getting the UI right
  * Syncing the app with the Nozbe web service via the [Nozbe API](http://www.nozbe.com/api)
  * Hiring a talented iPhone developer to get it done ([contact me if you want to help!](http://apivision.com/contact))

We're aiming at August/September launch date. I'll keep you posted.
