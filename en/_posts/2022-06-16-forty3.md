# 43 and I get to choose what I want to do

Welcome to my long-overdue [birthday blog post](/birthday/). I turned forty three almost a month ago but never got around to writing what this age means to me. Considering my personal and business situation, the [post-pandemic](/john/) world and the [war in Ukraine](/ukraine/), it all comes down to one thing: **I get to choose what I do from now on!** Below I'm explaining what I mean by that and which choices I'm making:

## Freedom to choose what I want!

At 43 I consider myself a lucky guy. I have a great home, a loving wife and three fantastic daughters. I have built [an amazing company](/nozbe15/) and I'm in a [great shape physically](/tri15/).

This all means that *I don't have to* do anything.

Yes, I must take care of myself and my family but it's not like I must do this or that to achieve it.

I get to choose what I do going forward.

I must nothing. I can be picky. I can choose how I spend my life going forward. I have enough. I achieved more than I ever hoped for. At 43 I'm free to choose what I do next.

That feels great.

But as always, *with great power comes great responsibility*. And with the power of this choice, I need to be very deliberate what I do with my business life next.

## Choice 1 - [Nozbe](/nozbe/) becomes a truly great business!

[Nozbe turned 15 this year](/nozbe15/) and we've finally announced that ["Nozbe Teams" is the "new Nozbe"](/clarity/). We have a clear vision for the product.

What you might not know is that until now I was Nozbe and Nozbe was me. My business was run as "[sole proprietorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship)", even though I have a team [of 20 people](https://nozbe.com/about/) onboard. I was running my company like this, because that's how I started and then *"if it ain't broken, don't fix it"* thinking kicked in and I just kept it all these years.

Well, now I chose to finally "separate" myself from the company and convert Nozbe into a [company with limited liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company) which in Polish is called: [spółka z o.o.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spółka_z_ograniczoną_odpowiedzialnością)

This means a new chapter for Nozbe. I will remain the majority owner and will hired myself as the CEO. In practice not much will change, but I feel like this symbolic "separation" of me and the company will help me focus working on the business more.

I want Nozbe to remain a "boutique company" with a worldwide impact. In 5 years I want both the team size to grow to around 40-50 people (2x) and the revenue at least 10x. We must embrace the shift from being just a [productivity](/productivity/) company to being a true team collaboration app.

Working on business means not only finding new ways of selling our software, but also internally on making the team better. I must make sure everyone's better than me for the position they were hired to do. And I must provide them all with as much resources as possible to be able to perform at the highest level.

This also means I finally need to hire a world-class VP of Marketing. Until today I was the designated and self-proclaimed chief of marketing at the company. I need to finally fire myself from this role to focus on my main role as the CEO. This will be a long journey but I'm hoping to ultimately find someone much better than me in this role in about a year or so.

I still believe that with Nozbe I can help millions of people get organized and work together in a better way!

## Choice 2 - finish and ship the [#NoOffice book](/nooffice/)

The first draft is complete and [you can read it online for free](https://NoOffice.org/book/). However I've never got around to finishing the book and truly shipping it: with a launch date, launch team, press outreach, etc.

I strongly believe this book could start a global movement.

A movement where [adults are being treated as adults by other adults](/adults/) and where:

> Work is not a place to go, but a thing to do.

## Choice 3 - appreciate every day what I have!

I want to end this post with some stoicism. Looking at the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine, I appreciate even more what I have. And that it can be taken away from me in any moment. Just like [5 Million people](/john/) who died of [covid](/covid/) and [Millions of Ukrainians who lost their homes](/nowar/) because of the crazy Russian dictator.

Nothing is for granted. Nothing lasts forever.

Let's enjoy life and choose things that really matter.
