# The Podcast #74 - Disrupted

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss a book by Dan Lyons about startups called "Disrupted". It's a humorist cautionary tale of how a company shouldn't be run and what's broken at the startup industry. We also argue that we think [Nozbe][n] never was a startup although we are in the technology industry. It's a short and good listen, so enjoy:
