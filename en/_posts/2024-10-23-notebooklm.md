# The Podcast resurrected with NotebookLM!

I've officially joined the AI craze and finally started testing many AI tools consistently. One of them is [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) which lets you create "notebooks" where you feed it with documents, sources, data and it summarizes things for you or answers your questions… or **creates a podcast!** Now, that last bit is really interesting and I'm using it now to  publish a podcast based off [of my writing](/money/):

## The two AI hosts are really smart!

Before I explain how this podcast episode was done, just spend your next 8 minutes listening to it (the AI magic starts after my 1-minute intro):

## How about The Podcast FM? Why not "ressurect" it this way?

Radek and I recorded [The Podcast FM](/podcast) for 4 years straight (2017-2021) and we stopped in May of 2021… but we still had a few hundred listeners ready for more content so instead of completely leaving this podcast be, I decided to "ressurect it" by using the AI co-hosts.

What's cool about it is that now the episodes are shorter but they are still very interesting as the discussions are based on my essays. Usually [the featured ones](/featured).

## From an essay to a podcast episode of two co-hosts talking!

Here's how this podcast was magically produced:

1. I set up the [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) account using my Google ID.
2. I created a "New Notebook" and added as source my latest essay: **[Time is Money](/money)**
3. Then I opened "Notebook Guide" and in "Audio overview" created the "deep dive" conversation.
4. I downloaded the audio file, imported to the Garage Band on my iPad.
5. I recorded intro in QuickTime on my Mac using my [podcasting setup and microphone](/streaming/) and also saved this file in iCloud and imported it to Garageband on the iPad.
6. I glued the two files together in Garageband and exported the project as an audiofile.
7. I created an episode in **Transistor.fm** where we host also [NoOffice podcast](/noofficefm) and that's it! Done.

## What's the conversation like?

Just [subscribe to my "The Podcast"](/podcast) to listen to the latest episode and the future ones.

> Wait, future ones? Will I be publishing more? Hell yes!

Oh yeah, I'm not stopping there. I'm going to be posting a regular weekly podcast by converting [my best essays](/featured) into these "deep dives" and posting them for your enjoyment.

However, I want to improve a few things:

- I might use multiple sources, like multiple articles of mine for one "deep dive"
- I will record a shorter intro, 1 minute is too much for this one. Just a quick hello and on with the show.
- I will record an outro maybe to ask a question or an other "call to action" depending on the show's topic.

Next up? [My essay on Weekly Template](/week)! Stay tuned for next week…
