# Team Productivity Podcast re-started with NotebookLM!

I've officially joined the AI craze and finally started testing many AI tools consistently. One of them is [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) which lets you create "notebooks" where you feed it with documents, sources, data and it summarizes things for you or answers your questions… or **creates a podcast!** Now, that last bit is really interesting and I'm using it now to  publish a podcast based off [of my writing](/money/):

## Listen to the latest episode "Time is Money"

Before I explain how this podcast episode was done, just spend your next 8 minutes listening to it (the AI magic starts after my 1-minute intro):

<source src="https://media.transistor.fm/4fddcca8/8ea55655.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

Alternatively: [Listen with Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+liSHHmdHA){:target='_blank'} or [Podcast website](https://teamproductivity.transistor.fm/14){:target='_blank'}

## From an essay to a podcast episode of two co-hosts talking!

Here's how this podcast was magically produced:

![{{ page.title }} audio](/img/notebooklm-audio.jpg)

1. I set up the [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) account using my Google ID.
2. I created a "New Notebook" and added as source my latest essay: **[Time is Money](/money)**
3. Then I opened "Notebook Guide" and in "Audio overview" created the "deep dive" conversation.
4. I downloaded the audio file, imported to the Garage Band on my iPad.
5. I recorded intro in QuickTime on my Mac using my [podcasting setup and microphone](/streaming/) and also saved this file in iCloud and imported it to Garageband on the iPad.
6. I glued the two files together in Garageband and exported the project as an audiofile.
7. I created an episode in [Transistor.fm](https://teamproductivity.transistor.fm) where we host also [NoOffice podcast](/noofficefm) and [The Podcast](/podcast) and that's it! Done.

## What's the conversation like?

Just [subscribe to my "Team Productivity" podcast][t] to listen to the latest episode and the future ones.

> Wait, future ones? Will I be publishing more? Hell yes!

Oh yeah, I'm not stopping there. I'm going to be posting a regular weekly podcast by converting [my best essays](/featured) into these "deep dives" and posting them for your enjoyment.

However, I want to improve a few things:

- I might use multiple sources, like multiple articles of mine for one "deep dive"
- I will record a shorter intro, 1 minute is too much for this one. Just a quick hello and on with the show.
- I will record an outro maybe to ask a question or an other "call to action" depending on the show's topic.

Next up? [My essay on Weekly Template](/week)! Stay tuned for next week…
