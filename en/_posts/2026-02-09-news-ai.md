# How I boost my productivity using AI - with real world examples

Let's talk about AI and let's be practical. Below I’ll share how my team and I are using AI at Nozbe – and why I believe it’s an amazing productivity booster.

## ☑️ Will AI take our jobs? Nope, but tedious tasks for sure!

Let's get the main concern out of the way. I don’t think AI will make us all unemployed. What I believe AI will do is improve our work – especially the tedious stuff we didn’t want to do anyway.

This isn’t new. Every major technological shift changes the job market. It automates and enhances our work. But here’s what excites me most: for some people, AI doesn’t just improve productivity – it gives them genuine superpowers.

## 🚀 How my team and I use AI daily - examples:

1. **Replacing “googling.”** Instead of typing keywords into Google and clicking through links, I just ask Perplexity on my iPhone directly. It’s faster, cleaner, and includes sources so I can verify the answers.

2. **AI as a tutor.** My daughter uses AI brilliantly – not to do her homework, but as a personal tutor. She asks it to create exercises, works through them herself, then asks AI to check her work and explain mistakes. That’s using technology the right way!

3. **Data analysis in minutes.** I uploaded our sales statistics to Claude and started asking questions: how many customers have 1-3 users? What’s the revenue percentage at each level? Instead of calculating it myself, AI draws conclusions – and sometimes suggests things on its own, like comparing our metrics to market averages.

4. **Translation in my style.** When I write my regular column for [iMagazine](/imagazine), I write in English first, then have Claude [translate to Polish](/pl/imagazine) based on my previous columns. The translation sounds like *me*, not generic machine output. I still review and correct it, but it saves enormous time.

5. **Automation that saves the day.** Our team member Paul once made a mistake with naming hundreds of file names. Instead of fixing them manually, he asked AI to prepare a renaming script. Within seconds – done. Hours of tedious work became one minute of clever automation.

6. **Content from content.** Paul also creates social media Reels scripts from our podcast transcriptions. Three scripts for three Reels – done. I still review and edit them to make them truly *mine*, but we’re saving significant time.

## 🔍 The golden rule: always verify AI

Here’s something I cannot stress enough: AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment.

AI can hallucinate. It can be confidently wrong. It can make things up that sound completely plausible. Always check calculations, have someone review translations, and read through finished materials thoroughly.

Think of AI as a brilliant assistant who needs supervision.

## 💪 How AI boosts productivity

Here’s what I’ve learned about AI and productivity:

1, **It saves time on tedious tasks.** You no longer need to spend hours on mind-numbing work. AI handles much of it for you.
2. **It lowers the barrier of entry.** I’ve always said the real productivity boost comes from making it easy to start. When AI does the research, translation, or initial draft, you have no excuse not to begin.
3. **It feeds your curiosity.** Feed AI your data, ask questions, get quick answers. Experiment. Get to the bottom of problems faster.
4. **It teaches better delegation.** To use AI effectively, you must prepare context and set expectations – exactly like delegating to a human. AI makes you a better manager.
5. **It gives you superpowers.** Having a capable assistant always ready to help means you can do more in less time and focus on what truly matters – where your unique input is the missing ingredient.

## ✅ AI features coming to Nozbe… soon!

Why doesn’t Nozbe have AI built in yet? Honest answer: we didn’t want to add AI just because it’s trendy. We wanted it to be genuinely useful.

That’s why we spent 2025 experimenting – learning what AI does well, where it fails, and how it could realistically help our customers. Now we have ideas for AI features that will help create projects, assist with tasks, and analyze data in new ways.

We’re also mindful of your data. We don’t want it leaking to OpenAI or anyone else. That’s why we’re introducing AI features carefully, one by one, using our own servers where needed.

**Want to see what we’re building?** Join me at our AI webinar, tomorrow, on Tuesday, February 10, at **[Nozbe . AI](https://nozbe.com/webinar)?c=michaelteam)**.

## 🤖 Let AI help you get things done!

AI isn’t here to replace us. It’s here to amplify what makes us uniquely human: our creativity, judgment, and ability to make decisions that matter.

Start experimenting. Verify everything. Stay authentic. And enjoy your new superpowers.

*See you at the webinar next Tuesday!?*

Yours productively,
