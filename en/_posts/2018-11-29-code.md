# Why I find joy in programming even though I don’t get to code much these days

With the passing years in business (and it’s been almost 12 years since I started Nozbe!) I realize that one of the keys to a long term success is to keep finding these small moments of joy in your work... and recently I found it back in programming... back in tinkering with code... here’s why:

## I miss coding... just like I miss building lego blocks...

I’m a self-taught programmer. I’m a geek. I managed to learn programming enough to be able to code the very first version of Nozbe which launched back in 2007.

Now I don’t code anymore, I hired programmers who are much better than me... so they won’t let me contribute to [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com) code base... which makes sense - as the CEO of Nozbe I should be focused on leading the team, and not writing code.

But I still like coding... and I miss coding from time to time. To me, coding is like playing with Lego blocks - you put a few things together and suddenly they become a new thing. A new invention.

## Recently I got to code again!

Yes, over the last few weeks for some internal purposes I had a chance of putting my skills into building some small HTML sites as well as JS and PHP scripts. It was so much fun! I got to play with all the technologies I used to be so familiar with.

And the best part, I got to do it all on both the iPhone and the new iPad Pro:

- using [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com) to code - this app is amazing!
- using [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) to push stuff to GitHub 
- using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to find answers for questions - this is an amazing resource - I don’t know how I managed to build Nozbe back in the day without it... now life is so much easier.
- using [Siri Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055) to build some additional scripts that help me get stuff done faster

What I really liked about these challenges is that they helped me think both [as the CEO](https://michael.gratis/nozbemichael) (thinking of processes we need to put into place) and as the programmer who’s tinkering with code... and when I didn’t know something, I could always ask my [talented team](https://nozbe.com/team) for help.

## Now I’m trying to teach my daughter to code :-)

On the weekends I spend coding in [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) with my 9-year old daughter. She loves the challenges and I love passing on to her my passion for building stuff using code.
