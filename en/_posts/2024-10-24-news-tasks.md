## 1️⃣ Clarify Expectations 🎯

When you create a task for someone, don't just write an outcome you want, but add a clear expected deadline, explain your priority level and just take your time to set expectations correctly.

## 2️⃣ Use Templates 📝

Create reusable project templates or recurring tasks to ensure consistency when delegating repetitive tasks. Re-use checklists and update old ones so that nobody is forced to re-invent the wheel!

## 3️⃣ Assign the Right Person for the job 🤓

Ensure that tasks are delegated based on team members’ strengths and expertise as well as their workload. Don't give everything to the busiest person, but the right person!

## 4️⃣ Attach Context 🔧

Provide all necessary documents, links, or references to the task to minimize follow-up questions. Even if you're a manager, do your homework and explain in detail what you know so far about the task.

## 5️⃣ Set Clear Deadlines and Checkpoints ☑️

Explain how you want to be informed about each phase of the task, when you need to be notified and which steps need your additional feedback. Be clear about what you really want!

## 👩‍💻 Bonus: Use technology like Nozbe! ✅

Use a dedicated tool for task-based communication with a clear structure of PROJECTS > TASKS > COMMENTS that syncs with all of your devices - just like Nozbe! 💜
