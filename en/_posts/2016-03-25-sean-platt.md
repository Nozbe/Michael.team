# How to write. Fast. Interview with Sean Platt for the Productive! Magazine 32

A great interview with Sean Platt - speaker, published author, and founder of the Sterling & Stone Story Studio, and most importantly - DAD. I talk to him about learning to write really fast as well as about getting into a flow and looking for excuses. Sean also offers some advice for aspiring authors and tells how his usual writing day looks like. [Productive! Magazine #32](http://productivemag.com/32)
