# The Podcast #85 - Magic Spreadsheet

Last week on [The Podcast][p] we discussed Radek's "Magic Spreadsheet" - his idea on measuring almost everything daily in a spreadsheet. How we started it, why it keeps him motivated (and accountable)... and why I started doing the same thing inspired by his results and data. We share what we collect, how we write it down... and why you should also give a magic spreadsheet a try!
