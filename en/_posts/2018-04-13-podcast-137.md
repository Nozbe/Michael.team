# The Podcast #137 - Nomadic lifestyle

After my Easter holidays I’m a little backlogged here, and as I’m preparing for our semi-annual [Nozbe Reunion](https://sliwinski.com/reunion) it’s good to give you this episode of [The Podcast][p] where Radek, my co-host, shares his tips and tricks on living a nomadic lifestyle, where he travels so much more than he used to!
