# LEGO Ferrari Daytona SP3

I have a long-standing tradition of getting a cool [LEGO set](/lego) each Christmas and in 2023 I got an amazing car - [**Ferrari Daytona SP3**][l] which is enormous! Almost 4K blocks (3778 to be exact) based on a [$2.5M dollar hypercar][f] and this time it took me almost a year to build it as I couldn't find the time for it. In the end it's here and it's gorgeous.

## Christmas gift - LEGO Ferrari Daytona SP3

As per tradition, I found this beautiful Lego set below my tree and it looked majestic:

## Box like no other - 3 pieces with instructions and parts

The box even was exquisite. Unboxing this Lego set was something else:

## Step 1 - lay it all out on the table

I started off on January 11, laying it out on the table and putting the pieces from the first set of Lego bags in the boxes of my old [Apple Watches](/applewatch), which are very useful for lego building:

## Step 2 - the engine

The original [Ferrari Daytona SP3][w] is famous for its naturally-aspirated 6.5L V12 that produces 840 PS (618 kW or 829 hp). Here it is:

## Step 3 - the chassis

Three first parts of the build are done and you can see the chassis of this car and it's time to start building its front.

Finally, later in March I got to the end of book 1 where you could see the difference between the Lego steering wheel and the original one:

## Step 4 - getting to bag 5 and taking a break…

Later that year I was traveling and working a lot so I had no time to finish the car. I managed to get to bags with number 5, past the page 666:

And here's where I ended up before the summer time:

## Step 5 - ready for doors and seats…

Only in October I got back to building the car and it started to take shape. Now it was time for doors and seats:

## Step 6 - almost done!

By November 11, the car had doors, seats and almost everything there. It was time for the last bits and pieces to make it look great:

## Step 7 - the car is ready!

By December 6 I managed to finish the car. It took me almost a year to build it as I had a very busy year with lots of travels and lots of work and apparently not enough time for [Lego](/lego):

## Ferrari Daytona SP3 looks great…

…especially with open wing doors:

…it looks aggressive at the front:

…and beautiful at the back:

Overall, the car works:

## A great collection of 3 supercars!

Now my collection of 3 amazing supercars is complete - they look great together: [Porsche GT3RS](/gt3), [Bugatti Chiron](/chiron) and this Ferrari:

## How about a real-world Ferrari?

If you want to see how the real-world [Ferrari Daytona SP3][f] looks like, check out the video by Doug DeMuro:

The only shame is that this car is in limited production of 599 and we will hardly see it on the streets as apparently people who could buy it are mostly car collectors so they will hardly ever drive it.

Unless they are a Ferrari Formula 1 driver, [Charles Leclerc][wc]:
