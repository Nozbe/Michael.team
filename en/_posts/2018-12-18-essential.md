# Essentialism is easier when you’re forced to choose what’s really important

I’m a big fan of [Greg McKeown](https://sliwinski.com/greg-mckeown)’s book, [Essentialism - the pursuit of less but better](https://sliwinski.com/essentialism) - I’ve read the book three times, [took lots of notes](https://sliwinski.com/essentialist) and keep trying (and failing) to follow Greg’s advice... and today unexpectedly I had a tough day that taught me a lesson or two on essentialism.

## A personal situation changed my day completely...

When I was doing my weekly review last Friday I had a very solid plan for this week, including a strong to-do list for today - for Monday. After all, it’s the last week before Christmas and there’s so much to be done!

And then something happened on Sunday. A family situation required my attention... and I had to deal with it also today...

## When my back was against the wall... I knew exactly what to do.

So today I knew I had to tend to my family and in between I had only maybe 3 hours of work max... so I quickly looked at my to-do list and refocused everything.

I knew what was essential. I knew what I should do today... and what can be left for later.

**And that’s what I did.**

And I had a great day. I managed to move important things forward at the company in the limited time I had... and later could completely focus on the family matter at hand.

## There must be a lesson right here...

A lesson in constraints... in evaluating what’s important...

When facing this important situation I somehow knew what to do.... so why when I’m not in a predicament like this, I’m trying to do everything possible and more?

My life is important. There’s only one life I have. Maybe I should be more mindful about creating this sense of urgency and importance all of the time... not only when I’m being forced to do it by external situations?

Maybe I just need to be better at editing my life... and when I have a plan, practice trimming it down by answering this simple question:

> *“Great plan for next week, but what would I do, if I only had half that time next week? What would I focus on? What would be essential to move forward?”*

Yes, that’s what I have to ask myself at the end of my each [weekly review](https://sliwinski.com/weekly-review)... and edit the plan again. Let’s try to do it this [Friday.](https://sliwinski.com/tgif)
