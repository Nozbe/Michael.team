# Building lego McLaren F1 car

I’m a big fan of LEGO bricks and on this blog I’ve already shared how I built a [Lego Baby Yoda](/yoda) and [other Lego sets](/lego/). Building Lego bricks brings me joy. That’s why I decided today and in the future to share with you the process of building Lego and hopefully spread the joy to you even more. Recently I built the [McLaren Formula 1™ Race Car](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mclaren-formula-1-race-car-42141) car and it’s stunning:

## I'm a Formula 1 fan!

I'm watching Formula 1 (in short: F1) races as they are scheduled. I used to watch some races when I was younger but I became a huge fan when [Robert Kubica](/kubica/) started racing (and later [crashed](/indestructibles-hermann-maier-and-robert-kubi/)). I've been commenting on F1 in the past: [Jenson Button's epic race](/jenson-button/), [Sebastian Vettel's wrong behavior](/sebastian-vettel-of-f1-sport-fails-to-inspire/) or the [efficiency of the F1 pit lane](/f1-pit-lane-iterate-quickly-and-focus-on-the/).

That's why it was only natural that I'm gonna get an F1 lego set and build it.

## Building a Lego F1 McLaren car

I love to take my sweet time to build a Lego set. I bought it for my birthday in May and built some of it in June and finished it in September after I was back from my holidays.

### Step 1. The F1 Engine

Here's the Lego version of the [F1 1.6L V6 Hybrid engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_engines#2022–2025):

### Step 2. The Drive train

After the engine it's time to attach some wheels to it:

### Step 3. The Look - part 1

Now the car starts resembling a true F1 vehicle:

### Step 4. The final look of the car!

Now the car is built. I decided not to put all the stickers on it, just the ones I considered the most important!

## Putting the Lego F1 McLaren on the wall of my [Home Office](/office/)

Now that the car is ready, it's time to put it on the wall of my home office. Do you like it?
