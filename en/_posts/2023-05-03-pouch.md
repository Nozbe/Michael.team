# What's in my travel tech pouch?

Two years ago [I posted the contents of my backpack](/backpack/) and all the tech gear I have there. Until recently that's how I was carrying all my cables and tech. However recently I re-examined my setup and bought some new pouches and from now on this is how I'm carrying all my gear:

## Travel tech pouch

**Update in 2024**: [I updated my travel pouch in 2024 as I moved to the USB-C lifestyle](/backpack24/)

Recently I've been traveling much more and very often I'm on the road with either just my wife or with my entire family, so I realized I needed a bigger tech pouch with more cables and I bought:

[**"Tech Pouch" from Peak Design in "Midnight" blue color**](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch/?variant=33179386183757):

It's incredible. It fits not only all of my cables, chargers, power banks and dongles, but also a small toiletry pouch:

## Everyday tech pouch

I don't need that many things when I'm just leaving the house with the [iPad](/ipadonly) in my daily backpack so for that purpose I have a much smaller "everyday tech pouch", which I bought from my favorite YouTuber:

In there I have just few the most necessary cables and chargers:

Here's the full list from left to right:

- Anker nano USB-C charger (20W)
- USB-C to USB-C cable
- USB-C to Lightning cable
- [Peak Design mobile tripod](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/mobile-tripod)

## Two pouches always ready to go!

When I go on a longer trip, I take the big travel tech pouch. While going through airport security I take out the pouch from my backpack, open it up and put it on the tray, take out the toiletries pouch as well and put it to the side.

When I just go outside in my town, I take the smaller pouch.

I don't take cables or dongles out of these pouches at home. If I need a cable or dongle for my permanent [home office](/office) use, I buy an additional one.

This way whenever I'm going outside, I can rely on these pouches being ready for me!
