# USB-C all things! Trimmer? Lamp? Glasses? Batteries?… or why companies should finally drop their own chargers!

For the last two years my most important daily devices have had USB-C ports: [iPhone](/iphone15ultra) and [iPad](/ipadm4/)… and gradually I've been migrating from gadgets that require ports like Lightning or micro-USB… I'm now fast-charging the [Watch](/ultra) using it's dedicated USB-C cable (which I'm also using to charge my [AirPods](/airpodspro/))… and as I've been enjoying this USB-C lifestyle, I started looking at other appliances that don't have old-school dedicated chargers but are using USB-C instead! Here are my latest discoveries:

## USB-C Beard trimmer?

I've been [trimming my beard](/beard) since 2019 and I've always been using a Braun trimmer. However, this renowned company [known for its design](/designed/), seems to be stuck in old school days and keeps bundling a dedicated charger with their trimmers. While I still use this at home, when traveling I don't want to be bringing another charger. It's bulky and wasteful. So I bought a [SUPRENT USB-C trimmer](https://www.suprent-eu.com/products/suprent-adjustable-beard-trimmers-bt575bx) ([Amazon link](https://amzn.to/4mnDIpI) / [🇪🇸](https://amzn.to/3GMo08s)) and I love it!

It feels like a cheaper knockoff of Braun, has a similar length of hair adjustment but most importantly… charges using USB-C! And I have plenty of USB-C cables and chargers in my [backpack](/backpack).

## USB-C lamp?

We've found this lamp (see picture above) in a Dollar store and it's a great lamp… that can be easily recharged. Great.

## USB-C glasses?

I've been using many different smart [sunglasses](/sunglasses/) and all charge using USB-C. See the photo above of my latest cycling glasses with Bluetooth speakers. Great!

## USB-C AA and AAA Batteries?

When I saw [MKBHD's short video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/acaAW3p5Tqw) I had to get them and now they are here and these rechargable batteries are glorious. Now I can re-charge them anytime I want with my [iPhone](/iphone) charger!

## Better USB-C charger?

[Anker USB-C chargers](/anker/) are great but the number of ports on them has been lacking. Now I've found this new **140W Anker charger** ([Amazon 🇪🇸](https://amzn.to/4feq31x)) which has 3 USB-C ports (and 1 USB-A which I don't need much anymore) so I can really charge all my USB-C things!

## USB-C all things!

It's a great time to be alive to have ONE port not only for my main devices, but also for other gadgets and appliances!

I dare all holdouts like Braun and others to embrace this standard and drop their proprietary chargers. There's no point in making us buy these anymore.

When faced with a choice between two products in the same category, I will always choose the one with USB-C port, even if it's objectively not as good as the other one.

The convenience of USB-C wins every time.
