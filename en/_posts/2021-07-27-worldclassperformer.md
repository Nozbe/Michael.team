To have a taste of it, here's my quote on [#NoOffice](/nooffice):

> **What is one thing that you do that you feel has been the biggest contributor to your success so far?** I run my company 100% remotely. We don’t have a physical office, and everyone on the Nozbe team works from home. This way, people don’t waste time commuting to and from work. They can adjust their working hours to their private lives and be there for their close ones when they need them. They can work in focus that none of the typical open-space habits can ruin. You can learn everything I have to say about the advantages of working remotely in my latest open-source book at [nooffice.org](https://NoOffice.org/).
