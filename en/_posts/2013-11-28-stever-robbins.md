# Interview with Stever Robbins  - Productive! Show #60


Three years after interviewing Stever Robbins for Productive! Magazine #6 I talk to him again. Famous Get-It-Done-Guy speaks on his shift from micro-tips to macro-things like: approaching yourself, your wife, your career; on abandoning the idea of life goals and picking up the idea of live-coaching show. To learn more, watch the interview!
Please, forgive the poor quality of the video. I hope the discussion itself will make up for it. [Productive! Magaznie 6](http://www.productivemag.com/6)
