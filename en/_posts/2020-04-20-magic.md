# Magic Keyboard has arrived and it rocks and I made a video review of it!

Just today, ahead of schedule, I received the new Magic Keyboard for my beloved iPad Pro 11‚Äù and decided to record a short video about it. All edited with LumaFusion on, you guessed it, the same iPad Pro:

Hope you like it, it's been a blast recording and editing this video. Adding b-roll and just playing with it. I'll have more thoughts on this keyboard once I've typed some more on it, but so far I like it a lot! What do you think?
