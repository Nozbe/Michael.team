# A vision for the company and a product - Team Productivity Show #7

I spent July of this year to finally write a comprehensive vision for our new product, [Nozbe Teams][n] and how it relates to the vision of our team. It’s our big *WHY* as it expresses *what we truly believe in*.

In the future [shows](/vlog) and [podcast episodes](/noofficefm) I’ll be coming back to this vision and explaining even more why articulating a vision is so important. Instinctively we know what we believe in, but writing it down and putting it out there is really hard!
