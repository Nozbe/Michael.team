# Building Lego Baby Yoda

I grew up as a [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars) fan. I always admired Jedi knights and especially their [Jedi Master Yoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda). So when I got Disney+ for my kids and realized there was a new series from the Star Wars universe called [The Mandalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian) featuring a ["Baby Yoda" character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grogu) I had to watch it. I loved it. So this past Christmas I doubled-down on my childhood memories and got a [LEGO set "The Child"](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-child-75318) featuring this cute character made out of **1075** pieces.

## Inspired by the Yoda Jedi Master

In the Star Wars movies, Yoda appears in the original trilogy and the second trilogy and as a voice in the third trilogy. He officially dies at age 900 in *Return of the Jedi*.

Throughout his appearances he shares his words of wisdom:

> How feel you? Afraid are you? Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

About the dark side:

> Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you, it will.

About death:

> Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.

And finally on *just doing it*!

> Do or do not. There is no try.

## Building Grogu - the LEGO "Baby Yoda"

To remind me of these words of wisdom, the old Yoda Master and the Star Wars universe, I decided to build this cute creature and have it in my [home office](/office). Step by step:

### 1. Basic structure of "Baby Yoda"

### 6. Head almost ready. Looking cute!

After this last step I finished everything [on January 12](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ8QbHiHCBg/) and now I have a cute "Baby Yoda" next to my main desk in my [home office](/office) and I think it's looking great!
