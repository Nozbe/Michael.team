# Get yourself Bluetooth sunglasses this summer!

Now that the summer is looming and it’s going to be the hottest summer in the history of mankind, you should be wearing sunglasses. If you’re like me, and you like to listen to [podcasts](/guest) or [audio books](/books), consider getting a 2-in-1 - sunglasses with audio Bluetooth for around 30-40 bucks.

## The sound is not great, but it’s OK for casual walking and listening.

If you need perfect audio, get [AirPods Pro](/airpodspro) but walking with headphones is a little anti-social and most of all can be little inpractical especially in the summer heat. And you're wearing sunglasses anyway, so why not wear the ones that play audio?

I used to own Bose Frames, but they are discontinued now and they were very price'y and would die after a year or so, so I switched to these cheap but OK [OhO Sunglasses][a] which can be had for 30-50 bucks on Amazon.

Again sound is so-so, but conveniece is great. Enjoy!
