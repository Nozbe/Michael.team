### September 21 - 7 Months in, Putin announced a partial mobilization order for some 300,000 reservists to join the war.

> Russians panicking about mobilization 7 months into the war is fascinating to me. Did you not know your country started the bloodiest war in Europe since WWII? Were you really hoping to not be personally affected by it at all? [You thought only minorities would be sent to die?](https://twitter.com/yanamrzv/status/1572539876817670147)

### August 26 - Pope Francis remarks the death of Dugin's daughter as the "death of the innocent"

> I think of all the cruelty—of so many innocents who are paying the price for this madness. The madness is from all sides because war is madness and no one who is in a war can say, "No, I am not mad." War is mad. I think of a poor girl who was blown up by a bomb under her car seat in Moscow. The innocent pay for war. The innocent. [Rome Reports](https://www.romereports.com/en/2022/08/26/pope-francis-remarks-on-the-murder-of-darya-dugina-spark-controversy-in-ukraine/)

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian foreign minister… argues that Darya Dugina was not so innocent and calls her an advocate of Russian imperialism. He denies Ukraine's involvement in her murder and accuses Russia of killing her in order to create a martyr and blame Ukrainians.

### August 21 - Six months of the war!

[War reporter exposes unimaginable evil in Kherson](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11086027/Insider-accounts-obtained-veteran-war-reporter-expose-unimaginable-evil-Kherson.html)

…and [The Guardian reports burning Ukrainians to death in a Russian prison camp](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/russian-prison-camp-ukrainians-deaths-donetsk)

### August 5 - Putin and Erdogan talk again, boost corporation and agree on rouble payments

[Disgraceful. Turkey is complicit](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1555645037966499846).

### August 4 - Amnesty International disgraces itself by victim-blaming Ukraine

> Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm’s way by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas. [Amnesty Tweet](https://twitter.com/amnesty/status/1555102962623594496)

[Amnesty International works for Putin now?](https://twitter.com/Renew_Democracy/status/1555246878970843139) Seriously, [they are](https://twitter.com/Vorkoz/status/1555554872304467969).

### July 25 - Russians terrorize occupied Ukraine

> “Russian forces have turned occupied areas of southern Ukraine into an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness...Torture, inhumane treatment, as well as arbitrary detention of civilians, are among the apparent war crimes we have documented." [By HRW](https://twitter.com/anneapplebaum/status/1551584414336950273)

### July 24 - NO WAR slogans in Germany are Russian propaganda

> [«НЕТ ВОЙНЕ»](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1551299242936893447) reeks of privilege and virtue signalling. If you can say “no to war”, then you’re not at war; there is no russian army destroying your home and killing your loved ones.

### July 23 - After a deal for grain export, Putin celebrates with striking Odesa

[Deals with Putin make no sense](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1550886038620569600).

### July 19 - Erdogan meets Putin yet again

[And he makes Putin wait](https://twitter.com/TygodnikNIE/status/1549493810836684805).

### July 17 - 8th year anniversary of MH17 airplane shot down by Russian BUK

[I still can't believe it's been 8 years](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1548666546909638656) and all the western governments did not condemn Kremlin despite Russian army shot down a civilian plane with 298 people on board.

### July 8 - Russian army is looting Ukraine

The city of [Mariupol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol) has been completely destroyed by Russian invaders. Prior to the war, 450k people were living there. Now it's less than 100k. Not only have the buildings been completely damaged but apparently [Russian invaders have been looting the city museums](https://twitter.com/anneapplebaum/status/1545150814464970753). Just like the Nazi Germany in the WWII.

### July 7 - G20 Summit starts with Russia's foreign minister participating

It's hard for me to imagine that [Sergey Lavrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Lavrov) - Russia's minister of foreign affairs can actively participate in a summit along with other leaders - while Russia is attacking Ukraine and, by proxy, their countries. He should be handcuffed and sent to [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice) if you ask me. [He eventually left the Summit as he was completely ignored](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1545316656808853504).

### July 5 - Finland and Sweden are joining NATO

As a direct result of the threat of Russia attacking other countries beyond Ukraine, Finland and Sweden have started their process of joining NATO, especially after Turkey said YES to the expansion on June 29. When will NATO expand to Ukraine to show Putin a true middle finger?

### Losses of Russia since February 24 (in 132 days of war)

According to Ukrainian intelligence Russia lost:

- 36 350 soldiers (150 in the last 24 hours!)
- 1594 tanks (5 in the last 24 hours!)
- 3772 armed vehicles
- 217 combat airplanes
- 187 helicopters
- 806 artillery systems
- 105 anti-plane systems
- 247 rocket launchers

### July 1 - missile attack on Odessa

At least 20 people died and 30 were wounded on the missile attack on Odessa - one hit an apartment building and the other a SPA resort.

Again, a vicious terrorist attack. These were not military objectives. The attack was performed at 2 am when people were sleeping. This is what Putin does. He's the most dangerous terrorist on the planet right now.

### June 28 - missile attack on a shopping mall

Missile attack on a shopping mall in Krzemienczuk in Ukraine while people were actively shopping there. More than 20 people died and countless wounded.

[President Zelensky:](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1541525200793206786)

> After today’s deadly missile attacks in Ukraine, Zelensky says “the Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact.” He tells the international community that doing any business with Russia “means giving money to terrorists.”

### June 23 - Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Moldova 🇲🇩 are officially EU candidates

Both countries have an official status of European Union 🇪🇺 member state candidates. Finally.

## Why this page?

It’s been more than 100 days of the Russia’s war on Ukraine 🇺🇦 and I still can’t believe it’s going on. Today. Right around the corner in a neighboring country to mine (I’m from Poland 🇵🇱). In 21st century. But it’s true and it’s still going on. And we can’t just accept it, we can’t just live our lives normally while people in Ukraine are fighting not just for their freedom but also for our freedom, too! That's why I'll be updating this page with recent developments to remind myself that the war is going on and that Ukraine must win and Putin’s Russia must lose. Fuck Putin (FCKPTN!). I will be updating this post regularly to remind myself and all of you reading this, that the war is there and it’s going on and we must do anything we do to help Ukraine win this. They’re not just fighting for their freedom, they’re fighting for the freedom of all the European Union 🇪🇺 and the world! ✌️ 

Who is on the FCKPTN photo above? It's my [Nozbe team](/nozbe/) in the **FCKPTN** t-shirts. [We are United with Ukraine 🇺🇦](/nowar/).
