# Building Bugatti Chiron Lego set back in 2018/19

Today is the first day of December 2023 and the Christmas time is upon us. Over the last few years in my family [we started a new tradition](/lego-building/), that every year as a Christmas present I get a [Lego set](/lego/) - usually a car or something from Star Wars. I've already posted how I built several cars: an orange [Porsche 911 GT3RS](/gt3/) - which started the whole tradition and then a white [Porsche 911RS](/porsche/), an orange [McLaren F1 Car](/mclaren/) or a grey [Aston Martin DB5](/lego-building/). I also built a [baby Yoda](/yoda/). Well, I never posted how I built my second-biggest set - **Bugatti Chiron** which I got back in [2018](/2018). Here goes:

## Lego tradition after the Porsche GT3RS back in 2016

Nine years ago for the 2016 Christmas, I got my first big Lego set that started the whole tradition: [Porsche GT3RS](/gt3/). Later in 2017 I didn't get any new lego set (I don't think) but then for 2018 [I found this under my Christmas tree](https://www.instagram.com/p/Brz3J_jlAjG/):

[Bugatti Chiron](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bugatti-chiron-42083) made out of **3599** pieces based on the real [Bugatti Chiron with 1500 PS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron). This set had almost 1000 lego pieces more than the Porsche!

## Building with friends!

When you have thousands of Lego pieces to build, it's always great to get your friends involved in the process:

Here's my close friend Tomasz, who's got PhD in engineering (so a competent friend at that!), and we're just two adults casually enjoying building a super sports car:

## When 2 parts of the car come together

Just like in the case of the [Porsche GT3RS](/gt3/), here there were also two parts that needed to be joint together. In the case of Bugatti though, it was front and back that needed separate assembly:

## Book 1 done, time for book 2

This is how the car looks like when we're half way there! There's still a lot to do but the car is taking shape:

## Bugatti Chiron done!

I don't have more photos of building the car as I probably was just focused on getting it done. This is the car when I finally finished it on [March 16, 2019](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvEpFzhlKRw/).

At some point I even put the car on the wall next to our old [Nozbe][n] logo.

I still love this car. It looks great next to my Porsches and the blue color really stands out. At some point I'm thinking of taking it apart and building it again - just for fun!
