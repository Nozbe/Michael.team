# Psstâ€¦ donâ€™t tell YouTube that I created a page to watch videos without being tracked ðŸ¤«

On [my iPad](/ipadonly) not only I can [download YouTube videos](/youtube-dl/) now, I also created a [special page](/yt/) to be able to watch YouTube videos without being tracked. Hereâ€™s why I did it and why I hope YouTube/Google will not find out about it:

<!--More-->

## We're tracked too much! Let's start using "Private Mode"

On both my iPad and iPhone, by default I'm opening most of links in a "private mode" in the Safari browser. This way I'm not tracked by third-party trackers and don't care much about GDPR consents. I accept everything, check out the page content and later close the browser tab and all the cookies are being deleted.

This is how I also started watching YouTube videos. I don't have a YouTube app on my iOS devices. I watched the videos in a private tab directly on YouTube.com each time and life was good.

Until YouTube decided to "be evil". Just look:

They started forcing me to "sign in" with a pop-up, even though the sign-in button is right there in the corner! Now each time I want to watch a video in a new private tab, I have to dismiss this pop-up.

That's not all! Right after I get **yet another pop-up** to accept their tracking. Only then I get to watch the video, and even then sometimes for some reason the video doesn't load correctly so I have to refresh the page.

This was annoying so as a geek I decided to do something about it. It's legal and the best part is that you can use it, too!

## Launching: [Michael.team/yt](/yt)

I [created a page](/yt/) where I can paste any YouTube link and thanks to some [JavaScript goodness](https://jsfiddle.net/MichaelTeam/a68rnjyt/) it automatically embeds the video on this page and I can instantly watch it and:

* I'm not being tracked (I use *youtube-nocookie.com*)
* I don't get any popups
* I can tap/click to watch video full-screen on both the iPhone and the iPad
* When full-screen, I can change to watch the video picture-in-picture on iOS
* I don't see an ad before the video
* and I think I don't get as many ads as YouTube isn't profiling me

Lots of benefits, and the only downside is that a small portion of videos won't work (the ones that don't allow embedding on 3rd party pages like mine). But that's hardly a problem.

## Siri Shortcut to "Share a video"

I've also created a handy [Siri Shortcut][shortcut] that helps me share any YouTube link directly to this page!

## Enjoy... and don't tell YouTube!

Feel free to use my new special page together with the Shortcut. **Share it with your friends but don't tell YouTube** I've created this to avoid being tracked by them!
