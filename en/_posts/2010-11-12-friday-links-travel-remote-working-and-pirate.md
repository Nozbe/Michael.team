## [Are you a pirate?](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/are-you-a-pirate/) by [Michael Arrington](http://twitter.com/arrington)

You love him or you hate him, but Mike has his moments and this article is one of them. He captured the mindset of guys taking risks to run their own game... I'd like to think I'm also a "pirate" running [Nozbe][n]

## [8 exotic destinations you can afford](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/11/04/exotic-destination-bargains/) by [Tim Ferriss](http://twitter.com/tferriss) and Tim Leffel

Talking about me traveling, did you see my yesterday's [Productive! Show video](http://www.productivefirm.com/2010/11/smartphone-vs-laptop-on-weekend-trips-to-london-episode-28/) recorded over my recent weekend trip to London?

Have a great weekend!
