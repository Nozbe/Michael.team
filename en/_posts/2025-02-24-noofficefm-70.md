**Important info - EPISODE NUMBER CHANGE!** Our previous episode was [episode 58](/noofficefm-58) so you haven't missed any other episode. We just decided to harmonize the episodes of this podcast and our sister podcast in Polish, [Nie Ma Biura](/pl/niemabiura) that's why we bumped the episode numbers from 59 to 70. Sorry for the confusion
