# Productive! Magazine #9 and #1 on the iPad


Chances are that if you follow [my Tweets](http://twitter.com/MichaelNozbe) you know by now that recently we launched a [new Productive! Magazine iPad](/magazine/) app with both - the old issue with [David Allen](http://twitter.com/gtdguy) (back from PDF from Nov 2008) and the newest issue with [Laura Stack](http://twitter.com/LauraStack). It's kind of a big deal for me. Let me explain.

## [Issue #1 with David Allen on the iPad](http://Productivemag.com/1) and many many productivity bloggers

When my good friend [Maciej Budzich](http://www.mediafun.pl) approached me with an idea to do a productivity-oriented magazine I loved it right away. I just didn't know how to pull this off... 

## I asked friends to help :-)

Firstly I approached [Oliver Starr](http://twitter.com/owstarr) who was then working for [David Allen Company](http://www.davidco.com) and [David Allen](http://twitter.com/gtdguy) himself if they wanted to participate and do an interview with David for the issue #1. Guess what? They agreed!

Then I started emailing the productivity bloggers I knew and respected to ask if they wanted to participate as well. Guess what? Many of them said yes! Finally when the magazine [was ready at the end of November 2008](/1st-productive-magazine-launched/) (almost three years ago!) we had an amazing lineup of articles and a great interview with David:

- **Interview with David Allen by Oliver Starr**

- Top 10 reasons why happiness... by [Alexander Kjerulf](http://twitter.com/alexkjerulf)

- GTD Primer by [Michael Ramm](http://twitter.com/michaelramm)

- The 5 W's of Weekly Review by [John Kendrick](http://twitter.com/jbkendrick)

As you can see, the lineup for the first issue was just fantastic. **No wonder more than 200,000 people read this issue alone :-)**

With next issues we managed to attract more great gurus to interview like [Guy Kawasaki](http://twitter.com/guykawasaki), [Michael Bungay Stanier](http://twitter.com/boxofcrayons), [Leo Babauta](http://twitter.com/zen_habits), [Luis Miguel Urrea Guia](http://twitter.com/miguelguia), [Stever Robbins](http://twitter.com/Getitdoneguy)  [Michael Hyatt](http://twitter.com/MichaelHyatt), [Jason Fried](http://twitter.com/JasonFried) and finally [Laura Stack](http://twitter.com/LauraStack):

Laura is the first woman on the cover of our magazine and this attracted more female contributors to the magazine and you'll see their articles in #10.

The issues #2, #3 and #4 are being currently ported to the iPad. The rest of the issues are there and here's my video about the magazine which I sent to my Nozbe users earlier this week:

Anyway. The magazine changed from a "pet project" to a fully-fledged magazine sponsored by [Nozbe][n]. With help from **Piotr Wo≈∫niak** (our new technical editor), our great editors **Lori Anderson** and **James Tonn**, my fantastic assistant **Delfina Gerbert-Czarniecka** and many other people who helped, the magazine is gaining traction and I love working on it.

Issue #10 coming mid-October and #11 coming mid-December. We'll stick with the bi-monthly schedule until the end of this year and hopefully next year we'll make it even a bigger deal than it is now :-) With your help, everything is possible.

## And there is one more thing...

Productive! Magazine #9 **will be released in Spanish** thanks to fantastic translation by [Augusto Pinaud](http://twitter.com/apinaud)! Watch it out soon! We're going to take the world by storm and bring the good word of productivity to everyone we can get.
