# Oscars tonight: I'm rooting for my high-school buddy's documentary: Our curse

I'm a film buff so I'm always interested in Oscars, aka Academy Awards. Tonight is special though -  it's personal - for the first time I'm really rooting for a film, and it's a short documentary by my high-school buddy, Tomasz Sliwinski, about his and his wife's struggle raising a child cursed with a very rare disease: [“Our Curse” (Polish: “Nasza Klatwa”).][A] Here's why I'm so excited about an award for this film:

## As a parent...

I've been following [Leo's story][B]  (son of Tomasz) after he was born. It's so unfair to have a child born with a disease, let alone such a rare one. It's the parents' worst nightmare and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Yet Tomasz and his wife have been “cursed” with such a situation and they're fighting bravely for their son to have as “normal” a childhood as possible. They are amazing. Wow.

## As a friend...

Although we're not related, Tomasz and I share the same family name. We went to the same high school to parallel classes. Because of the common last name we would laugh we were “brothers” :-) After high school we haven't seen each other much but we connected on Facebook a few years back and this is how I got to know his son's story. I didn't realize he was filming it... So I'm very happy and grateful that his and his wife's struggle resulted in such a success and now his work is nominated for an Oscar. Good luck Tom! You've earned it!

[The film is available online and you can watch it on New York Times web site][C]
