# The Podcast #76 - Management by walking around

This week on [The Podcast][p] we continue discussing concepts from a book by David Burkus: **Under New Management** ([Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01CIR380G?tag=sliwinski-20) / [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0544630971?tag=sliwinski-20)) - this time we focus on [open spaces - open offices](https://sliwinski.com/openoffice/) and why in our opinion they really suck for focused work. We also pick up a controversial concept of transparent salaries and reveal how we're approaching this in our own company, [Nozbe][n] - I'd love to get your feedback on that:
