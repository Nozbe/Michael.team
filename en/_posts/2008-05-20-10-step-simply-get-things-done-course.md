# 10-Step Simply Get Things Done Course using Nozbe version 1 (2007-2009)

Today is my birthday and I decided to give you a real treat - my [10-step Simply Get Things Done course](http://www.nozbe.com/course). It was initially performed by me in January, at the 2-weekly [Aula Polska meetings](https://aulapolska.pl/wystapienia/start-up-nozbe-com-simply-get-things-done-course-in-10-steps/). Later I decided to split the course into a bunch of short videos, adding a short screencast from Nozbe to each of them. The resulting 9 videos are below, starting with the first - **Step 1 - Inbox**:

## P.S. Update in 2022

It's amazing to see [Nozbe][n] come so far 15 years - it's completely different now, yet many if not most of these principles haven't changed. Technology is different, but the productivity principles stay the same.
