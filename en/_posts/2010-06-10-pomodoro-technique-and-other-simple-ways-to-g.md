# Pomodoro technique and other simple ways to get focused... now!


Today I quite a productive day... but at one point in time I was so swamped with small tasks that I couldn't get myself to do the big rocks for the day... I had two very important and quite big tasks related to [Nozbe][n] to do today... and the small tasks just seemed more appealing to me... sounds familiar, doesn't it? I just needed something to get going... and I remembered hearing about a "[Pomodoro Techinique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)" and decided to give it a try:

It basically goes like this:

## Turn off all distractions. Set a task to do and set a timer for 25 minutes. Do it until it rings. Take 5. Read more about it [here](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).

Well, it did the magic. I just started digging into my big task and because I had my timer ticking and counting down, I needed to rush and do the task. It's like having a deadline and thinking "I can't blow it!"

And guess what? **I did a task in 25 minutes! The whole thing... and I had it scheduled for 3 hours!**

OK, maybe I wouldn't have done it in 3 hours anyway but faster... apparently... but anyway, doing what I thought would be a very tiresome task in just 25 minutes blew me away.

Then I rested for 10 minutes, had a glass of water, and set a timer for the second task.

Again, I did it in record time - it took me around 20 minutes to get it done... again, it was a big thing and it was meant to take me like 2 hours.

I was blown away. And tired. Doing two big things in just one hour was tiring... but felt great.

## Why did I manage to be so effective?

1. I embraced the constraints. I knew I had 25 minutes and wanted to get it done in this record time. I stopped worrying about tools I'd use for the task, about how to approach it, about anything... I just headed straight to the heart of the matter of this task and got it done.

2. I didn't think about details or distractions. I focused on the task only, I turned off my email, twitter and other stuff. I didn't have time for these things.

What do I use as my "Pomodoro Timer"?

I use free software called [MacTimer](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/mactimer.html) - it works great, I set it for 25 minutes, it runs and screams when it's done. Perfect for this technique.

## These quick and dirty productivity techniques like Pomodoro are awesome

My friend Ivan Hernandez talks about two more simple productivity techniques, so [head over to his blog](http://ivanhernandezonline.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/3-simple-productivity-techniques/) for a full review of them.

_Did you try any of these? Did you try Pomodoro? Does it work for you? I'm going to be using more pomodoro from now on!_
