# Writing code on the iPhone 6 Plus. It can be done! How I wrote my "dice" app...

The other day my daughter and I wanted to play a board game. But we couldn't find a dice. I instinctively started searching for a dice app on the AppStore but what I found there were some shady apps. So I decided to write my own dice web app... How hard can it be, right? Especially that I had only my iPhone on me and no additional computer within my reach? Well, here's how I did it:

Firstly I needed some graphics. I downloaded the images from Wikipedia to my camera roll and uploaded them to my server using Transmit app.

Later I opened Textastic app and created a blank *index.php* file and right from that app I uploaded it to my server next to the images. Then I wrote a simple code with my iPhone using the Textastic app and uploaded the file to the server again. The code basically rotates the dice images at random. Easy. 

That's it, [my dice app was online][c] and both me and my daughter used it to play the board game. And she loved our new dice :-) The whole process took me less than 15 minutes and it was so much fun to have done it on the iPhone. 

**Update in 2020**: I updated the app to JavaScript and support for both 1 die and 2 dice. [I coded it on the iPad](/rolling/). **[Click here for the new dice](/dice/)**
