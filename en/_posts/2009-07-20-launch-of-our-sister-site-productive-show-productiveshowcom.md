# Launch of our sister site - Productive! Show - ProductiveShow.com

Our "Productive!" family keeps on growing. As we're preparing the launch of the all-new issue of the Productive Magazine (I'll announce the launch date this week!) I decided to compile my series of "2-minute productivity" shows into a separate blog called **"Productive Show"** at **ProductiveShow.com**. My goal is to publish a new 2-minute video about productivity every week. At this moment I just put all the archive videos I had on the topic and we'll go from there. We'll see how it goes, but I'll definitely give it a try. In the meantime I encourage you to check out our sister-site and let me know how you like the [2-minute videos with some really cool Productivity Tips and Tricks](/show/).
