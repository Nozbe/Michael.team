# How we should embrace and follow it: The Secret to Overcoming Any Fear

Very good post (and book excerpt) on Michael Hyatt's blog. When I was interviewing Seth Godin for the [Productive Magazine](/productive_magazine) he told me that whenever he's fearful and the "lizard brain" is telling him he should not do something - it's a perfect indication that it is exactly what he should be doing. **[The Secret to Overcoming Any Fear on Michael Hyatt's blog](https://michaelhyatt.com/overcoming-any-fear.html)**

This year a new movie with Will Smith is coming: "After Earth" with a perfect quote that keeps ringing in my mind:

> "Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. **Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.**"

That's why, don't choose to be fearful - go for it and make 2013 the best year yet - I know I'm about to :-)
