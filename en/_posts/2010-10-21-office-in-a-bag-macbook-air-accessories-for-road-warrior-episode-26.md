# Office in a Bag - Macbook Air & Accessories for Road Warrior - Episode #26

How to fit an entire mobile office in one bag? In this new episode of Productive! Show I'm sharing with you how I manage to fit my [Apple Macbook Air](/macbook-air-rocks-5-things-pc-notebook-manufa/) and all of the accessories into one small bag. This video was inspired by [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/my-new-carry-on-eagle-creek-tarmac-22/) and [Michael Hyatt](http://michaelhyatt.com/road-warrior-series-my-current-laptop-bag.html).
