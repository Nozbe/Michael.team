## [Wait To Worry: Procrastination at Its Best](http://gailbhyatt.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/wait-to-worry/) by [Gail Hyatt](http://twitter.com/gailhyatt)

Something I tend to forget and something my wife should practice, too... we shouldn't worry too much, it leads to bad things happening. Here's what Gail says about it:

> As a mom, when my girls go to a place of worry, I do the only thing I know to do. Since I can't take it from them, I encourage them to "wait to worry." Just postpone it. This is procrastination at its best.

## [Why write a book?](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/why-write-a-book.html) by Seth Godin

As I'm contemplating writing a book about bootstrapping a startup, I took Seth's article very seriously: 

> The goal isn't always to spread an idea. Sometimes the goal is to make change happen. A book is a physical souvenir, a concrete instantiation of your ideas in a physical object, something that gives your ideas substance and allows them to travel.

_Do you worry too much? Do you want to write a book? Yet alone a blog?_
