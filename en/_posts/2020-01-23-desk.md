# What's on my desk? Here's my re-designed stand up desk for 2020.

I'm slowly finishing off my [Home office](/office) renovation which [I mentioned in my previous post](https://sliwinski.com/office2020). I just upgraded my good trusty [IKEA stand-up desk](https://sliwinski.com/homeoffice2015/) (model: Bekant) by getting a new bamboo table top (model: Hilver) - itâ€™s wider and shallower than my previous one so thereâ€™s more space for my [iPad Pro](/ipadonly). Now that it's set up, let me show you what I've got there so hopefully it serves as an inspiration to you:

## Desk full of devices I need for my daily work ðŸ˜Ž

From left to right, here what's on my desk:

- **[iPad Pro 11"](https://sliwinski.com/whichipad)** - my main computer - I'm writing these words on it.
- **[iPhone 11 Pro](https://sliwinski.com/photo)** - my main phone on a stand [made by Radek](https://sliwinski.com/thepodcast-195)
- **[5K iMac 27"](https://sliwinski.com/lastmac)** - it's the late 2014 model which I bought in June 2015... and it's still an amazing computer and great additional canvas to the iPad Pro.
- **[Coffee cup](https://sliwinski.com/coffee)** - keeps my drink warm.
- **Jambox speaker** - connected to the iPhone via Bluetooth.
- **Mouse, Keyboard and Trackpad** - I'm right-handed but when I was young I learned to use the mouse with my left hand, so now I have the best of both worlds - a Logitech MX mouse for my left hand, Logitech K760 wireless solar keyboard for typing on the iMac and Apple black trackpad for my right hand.
- **[iPhone SE](https://sliwinski.com/iphonese)** - which I'm using for [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/teams) testing.
- **Ugreen wireless charger** for both the iPhone 11 Pro and the AirPods Pro.
- **Samson Q2U Microphone** for recording [The Podcast](/podcast) and [Zoom](https://sliwinski.com/zoom) video conferencing.

## How I balance my use of the iPad and the iMac?

Short story - I do most of my work (especially writing) on the iPad (that's why my iPad keyboard is so [beaten up](https://sliwinski.com/dad/)) while I use the iMac 5K as my "canvas" where I open more additional windows as there's plenty of space on this gorgeous 27" screen.

The iMac may be old, but it was a good spec (it pays off to buy higher-spec machine) - it has 16GB of RAM and 500 GB SSD + 2TB SSD in the back connected via USB 3.0 - so plenty of storage and power - it has all my iCloud photos downloaded and serves as additional local storage.

## 80% of the time...

It's a simple [Pareto principe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) - 80% of my work time at work I'm working standing at my stand-up desk. And 80% of my work time I'm actively working on the iPad and using all these other devices on my desk as "support system" for the iPad.

Because the cool thing about being [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly) is that at any point in time I can just take the iPad with me and work productively in any other place...
