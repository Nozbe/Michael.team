# Productivity videos from Taiwan

I've just come back home from a trip to Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ where I've had lots of great experiences, met my co-worker [Emilia](https://nozbe.com/emilia?c=michaelteam) and experienced a major earthquake. What's really important is that I've learned a lot during this trip, especially that it was to such an efficient-running and well-organized place like Taiwan. Here are a few shorts I recorded and published my new [**@MichaelTeam** YouTube Channel][y] during this trip:

## Meeting Emilia

Emilia works in [Nozbe support team](https://nozbe.com/contact?c=michaelteam) and thanks to the fact that she's based in Taiwan we have a major time zone difference and she can answer [Nozbe][n] customers' questions when everyone else from our team is asleep. When I meet people from my team we *work differently* because instead of "talking shop" we just focus on personal relationships:

P.S. Emilia's Taiwanese husband, who was a videographer here, runs their very very popular [YouTube Channel - over 200K subscribers!](https://m.youtube.com/@meetworldhome){:target='_blank'}

## Travel tips

I've begun my trip by sharing my favorite airport tips and tricks, like [having only a backpack](/backpack24/) and much more:

## Public Transport

Using Public Transport in Taiwan is a bliss. I'd even say it's a **solved problem** now. If the officials in your city or country want to revolutionize public transport or re-invent it, they should go directly to Taiwan, live with it for a week and they'd know how to get it done:

## Taiwan tips

Travel tips specific to Taiwan, but applicable to other places as well: get eSIM, use Google Lens and use local technology to be able to take advantage of the above-mentioned excellent public transport:

## Pouches

Speaking of travel tips, I love packing in pouches. [I have my tech pouch](/pouch/) and pouches for clothing. It's very efficient way of traveling:

## Earthquake

I've witnessed the biggest earthquake since 1999 in Taiwan and luckily I was fine. The good thing about this one was that Taiwan was much more prepared than 25 years ago - here's what they learned:

## Taroko Gorge

One of the things that did get significantly destroyed in the earthquake was [Taroko Gorge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taroko_National_Park) and because of that is closed indefinitely now, which is a shame. Luckily I was there a week before the earthquake and flew there with [my drone](/drone) and recorded some fantastic footage which I decided to share:
