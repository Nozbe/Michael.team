# Nozbe turns 14 today!

Today [Nozbe][n] - my [#NoOffice](/nooffice) [productivity](/productivity) company turns 14. Fourteen. This special anniversary opens a new chapter in my company’s life. We’ve got two products now - [Nozbe Personal and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/compare) and I’m about to finish my [most important book](https://NoOffice.org/). And there’s more…

## Two apps, one mission!

[As I wrote on the Nozbe blog][b]:

> Several years ago our all-remote team decided to put our work and communication experience into a new app - a to-do list for teams. That’s how Nozbe Teams came to be. Also this way Nozbe became a two-product company with Nozbe Personal for individual users and Nozbe Teams - for modern, both remote and office-based organizations.

And our mission stays the same:

> Through our apps, for the last 14 years we’ve been on a mission to help teams and individuals communicate through tasks to get more done and enjoy a better work-life balance.

[This hasn't changed. And there's more to come. Read more on Nozbe blog ⏩][b]

## More to come…

This year will be pivotal in my company's history. It's going to be exciting as I'm bracing for huge growth as the company's leader, manager, product visionary and marketer. And apart from that as a podcaster and an author. It's been 14 years since I launched my Nozbe project completely on my own from a corner of a living room in a rented apartment in Warsaw, Poland.

I've come a long way, yet I feel I'm only getting started.
