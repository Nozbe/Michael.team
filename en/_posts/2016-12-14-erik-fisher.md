# Interview with Erik Fisher - Beyond The Todo List host - Productive! Show

Recently [I've been invited to many podcasts](https://sliwinski.com/where) (thanks for having me :-) and one of my favorite ones was my guest appearance in Erik Fisher's [Beyond The Todo List](http://beyondthetodolist.com/michael-sliwinski-of-nozbe-on-remote-management-ipad-only-and-apple-watch-bttdl123/). We had such a great time that I invited Erik for an interview for the [Nozbe blog][b] and my community here on my personal blog. Hope you'll enjoy this interview as we discuss productivity essentials and Erik's methods for planning and staying on top of things.
