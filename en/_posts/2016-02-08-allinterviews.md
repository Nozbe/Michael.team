# Watch all the Inspiring Productivity Interviews with...

I launched the [Productive! Magazine][pm] back in 2008 and since then as the "editor in chief" I had a pleasure of interviewing amazing people for the magazine. All of them are role models to me, some of them are mentors and friends... and many of them you know of have heard of. Today, thanks to the power of [Nozbe.how templates][how] I'm giving you an easy way to watch all of them whenever you fee like:

## [Watch All Interviews at Nozbe.how free][h]

You can access all of these interviews on our [Productive! Magazine][pm] page or app, you can also see them on my [interviews](/interviews) page or on our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4VGcOPPsP4MpFYtpz9M4X_1u0M4vNbkp) but I think the best way is to use a project template created with [Nozbe][n] and [shared on Nozbe.how][h]

Why? Because each interview then becomes a "task" and in the details of the task you can see the link to the relevant Productive! Magazine issue and the direct link to the video to watch it. Once you've watched it, you can mark the task as done and watch another one. And you can mark as "done" also the interviews you don't want to watch. Easy.
