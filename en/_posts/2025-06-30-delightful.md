# Delightful feature - converting a section or task to a project

I’ve been running [Nozbe][n] for the last [18 years](/immature) and the value of [simplicity](/nozbe-values) has always been my northern star. That’s why whenever a Nozbe user finds one of these simplifying features **delightful** it always makes my day. Watch one of our [Nozbe experts](https://nozbe.com/expert?c=michaelteam), **[Mike St Pierre](https://www.mikestpierre.com)** discovered how easy it is to convert a section of a project into its own project in [Nozbe][n] with one easy click:

## Project sections in [Nozbe][n] are very powerful!

Splitting projects into sections can be very powerful:

- you can later convert them to projects (as seen above!)
- you can generate unique email address for a section to forward emails to particular project section!
- you can clone an entire section and copy/move it to a different project

[and so much more!](https://nozbe.help/taskmanagement/projects/#project_sections)

## You can also convert one task to a project…

…if you use a check list. Here’s Mike’s section if it was a checklist in a task and how easy it’d be to convert it to a project right from this task:

All you have to do is tap on task's options and choose "convert into a project" and voila!

## Do you find any other [Nozbe][n] features delightful?

[Let me know and I'll be happy to post about it!](/contact)
