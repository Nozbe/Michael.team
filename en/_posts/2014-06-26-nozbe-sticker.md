# How to apply a Nozbe Productivity Sticker? Productive! Show #72

*Note: To get this cool Nozbe sticker, go to [Nozbe Sticker (by MakeItStick) web site](http://Nozbe.com/blog/sticker) and choose your sticker size (11" or 13" or 15" or 17") and use coupon code* ***nozbe*** *to get 10% off - for limited time only for my readers*. This is not a typical Productive! Show episode. I recorded it as I couldn't resist sharing something with you. What is it? I am going to decorate my MacBook Pro with custom Nozbe sticker designed to fit the Apple computer.
