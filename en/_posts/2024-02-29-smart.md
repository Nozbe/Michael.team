## 😎 Smart Business Owners like yourself are modern professionals…

…who want to manage it all as effectively as possible from any device: computer, tablet or smartphone. You are modern, tech-savvy and unstoppable. You believe you can change the world! You’re S M A R T:

## S is for SIMPLICITY - you want to solve your business and life challenges in a simple way ☝️

You want powerful features hidden under a simple interface. You manage your business and personal life in a very simple structure of: projects, tasks and comments.

## M is for MEETINGS - they are important but you want to have only few of them 🤝

You believe that meetings should be *regular, optional and well prepared*. When you use Nozbe or other online collaboration platforms, everything is being discussed in a written form asynchronously.

## A is for AMBITIOUS - because your small team can do great things. 🚀

You plan and execute easily with projects. You set up templates as procedures. You convert emails to tasks automatically and your team is able to get more done than your bigger competitors!

## R is for REMOTE and hybrid work, so your team can have the flexibility of working from anywhere! 🌍

You know that *work is not a place to go, it's a thing to do*, right? Your online platform like Nozbe becomes your main office in the cloud available from anywhere.

## T is for TIME for work and leisure. You want to achieve the best work-life balance for yourself and people your work with! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧

You also believe you should be able to use the same great tools to manage your work projects as well as private ones. You work to live, right?

## ✅ As a SMART Business Owner you want to…

…execute in a SIMPLE way, have fewer MEETINGS and achieve your AMBITIONS while embracing REMOTE work and valuing TIME of everyone on your team. Does it sound like you?
