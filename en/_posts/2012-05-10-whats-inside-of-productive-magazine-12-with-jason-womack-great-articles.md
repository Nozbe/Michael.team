**1. My interview with Jason Womack where we explore how your best can get better!**

_"People who are the best continually go back for reaeducation, they go back for training, they go back for coaching..."_

_if you work on your weaknesses you might be an all around good tennis player but you wonat be dangerous, unless you work on your strengths._

_I dona't need to change and be a positive thinker but I do need to practice positive focus._

**2. Stephen Smith talks about his "Inbox Zero" setup**

_"You may want to reconsider all of the alerts and notifications that you are subscribed to."_

_"If the email is about something that you do not need to act on - then file it, archive it or delete it."_

**3. Jasmine Grimm (new contributor!) explains how she gets stuff done without a smartphone**

_"It's not like getting rid of the smart phone magically eliminated my e-mail, my phone and my sense of responsibility. Quite the contrary, it caused me to respect it more."_

_"It made me more organized because I wasnat constantly being interrupted"_ 

**4. Laura Stack explains how to create your perfect "Babysitting" system for working with others** 

_"If a project needs approval to proceed, and you don't have it, then find yourself at someone else's mercy."_ 

_"Always make sure that the lines of communication remain wide open between you and the other person."_ 

**5. Michael Hyatt proves that everyone may feel overwhelmed at times, but we can do something about it!** 

_"You must know which things you can safely ignore and which things demand your intervention."_ 

_"Practice workload triage. On the battlefield, medics have to decide where to apply their limited resources."_ 

**6. I'm sharing a productivity-boosting discovery I made when I started splitting the day in two parts** 

_"By dividing my time to morning time and afternoon time I can focus to create and set strategy from my company in the morning."_ 

_"I try to get my three main rocks (three most important tasks for the day) done by noon."_ 

**7. Graham Allcott shares his most recent productivity rules** 

_"I go to the office not to do my work, but to help the team do theirs."_ 

_"Everything we do, everything we consume, everything we own, everything we commit to, everything we put our attention on all takes us away from something else."_

**8. Productivity Shows I link to: [Standing Desk](/still-standing-stand-up-desk-and-productivity-show-42/), [Paper Pad](/paper-pad-helps-me-focus-show-41/) and full [Jason Womack Interview](/interview-with-jason-womack-for-the-productive-magazine-12/)**

**9. Leo Babauta says you can walk away from everything. You really can!** 

_"Those who are convinced they need to make the deal are in the weakest position."_ 

_"You donat need to walk away from everything, but you should know that you can."_
