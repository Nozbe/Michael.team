# Using a mouse with left hand… is right?

🐭 I'm using a mouse with LEFT HAND, even though I'm RIGHT-handed?! Do you know why?

## Because [#productivity](/productivity) - it's faster this way!

When I was in high school I was working for my dad as a "designer" in Corel Draw (manipulating vector objects) and I realized that when I used the mouse with right hand, I was very slow…

Because as I move an object and edit its label, I need to take my hands off the mouse on the keyboard to type it. Slow.

However, when I switched hands, I realized I could manipulate an object with my mouse in my left hand and type with my right hand. Faster and more efficient.

So I started using a mouse with my left hand. And after a few months I was as good as with my right hand.

## When my dad saw me do this…

He was shocked. Then curious. And then he learned the same thing because he found it very practical. Yep, my dad, too!

Now in my home office when I'm working on my M4 Mac Mini, I have a [Logitech Ergo keyboard](/ergo) with its number pad covered by a [Lego](/lego) stand and an Apple trackpad, which I'm manipulating with right hand.

🫲🏼 So that I can have my trusty **Mx Anywhere 3S** Logitech mouse in my left hand.

(On the picture above there's also my wife's rose mouse, because it's really cute)

Did you ever think to use your mouse with your OTHER hand?

🫵 Give it a try!
