# My first dubbed iPhone Air video review - do I still love it?

On [Fridays](/tgif) I co-host one of the most popular tech podcasts in Poland, [Nadgryzieni](/pl/nadgryzieni) with Wojtek and Tomek. With Wojtek we sometimes collaborate on creating extra videos for their Polish YouTube Channel, [just like I did for the Mac Mini](/2tb). This time I reviewed [my favorite iPhone Air](/air). I recorded the video in my mother tongue - Polish, so if you are Polish, you’ll hear my voice, but if you’re not, you’ll hear me auto-dubbed by YouTube - what do you think?

## What do you think about the [iPhone Air](/air)?

And how did you like my review? Should I be recording more of those? To be honest, it was lots of fun!
