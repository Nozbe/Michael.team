# The Podcast #58 - Peer Mentoring

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss a concept of "peer mentoring" which I firstly heard from my friend [Wiktor Schmidt](https://twitter.com/wiktorschmidt), which is about choosing mentors from your peers and scheduling time to mentor each other. Radek was pretty surprised by how I defined the concept and that my mentors don't have to be necessarily older than me. And that I see him as my mentor, too:
