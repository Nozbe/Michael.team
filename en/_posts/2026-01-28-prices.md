# How I calculated new prices for Nozbe that will be introduced in February

In a few days we are going to celebrate 19 years of [Nozbe][n] and with this we’re going to be also adjusting our prices ([last time was 2,5 years ago](/pricing-new/)). It’s basically an inflation adjustment but as I was preparing the new price list I also took an opportunity to see how we can make the pricing even simpler. Plus, I also hired AI to help me out… which was… interesting. Here's how I went about it all if you're curious:

## ✅ Rules of the new pricing structure in 2026

My philosophy as to pricing [was outlined in June of 2023](/pricing-new/) but basically it all comes down to these 5 rules:

1. Fairness of having just one pricing for all Nozbe customers
2. Savings for yearly payments at 20%
3. Savings as customers’ team grows
4. More tiers for smaller teams
5. Payless upgrade for customer convenience

These things haven’t changed much. However as I created this pricing, I’ve modified rules 2 and 3 a little:

**Rule 2 (2026): Nice-looking prices per user per month on annual plans that offer savings of 20%**

This means that our plans now start at 9 USD/EUR/GBP or 27 PLN per user per month when paid annually for the 1-user [Nozbe][n] plan. We advertise these prices.

**Rule 3 (2026). Cost per user per month decreases until plans of 10 users and remains flat on bigger plans.**

For 2-person account, it’s $8,50 or 26 PLN per user per month and the cost goes down with each tier until it reaches $8 or 24 PLN per user on 10-user plan. On all the bigger plans the cost per user per month stays at the same level.

This way we can truthfully say that a cost of a user in Nozbe can go as low as $8 or 24 PLN per month, which was basically the price of single-user accounts before the changes.

## Raising prices and communicating it is very stressful…

As I was writing an email about this price adjustment to all of the Nozbe users, which was sent to them on Monday, January 26, I couldn't get the words right.

I wanted to convey my gratitude of being able to run this business for 19 years and serving my customers with the best productivity tool there is… 

…while I needed to tell them that I had to adjust the prices to keep the business profitable…

…and sharing my excitement about new features, including first AI powers…

When I consulted AI and asked it to review my email and maybe shorten it a little I got a new version along with this comment which was to-the-point:

> This cuts about 15% while keeping all the key information. The main trims were removing repeated reassurances about the price increase — one clear, confident explanation is more effective than three apologetic ones.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I couldn't stop laughing at myself. AI was right.

## Rewarding old customers and supporters by giving them a heads up!

As always, we decided to give our most loyal customers heads up about the price hike. This way we let them still get Nozbe for a year at today's prices before the February deadline. This is how much we appreciate our loyal fans - after all - thanks to them I've been able to run a business for 19 years without any external investments.

Next week's Newsletter will be about AI productivity so stay tuned… and if you want to see me geek out about AI on our upcoming webinar on Tuesday, February 10 - [make sure to sign up!](https://nozbe.ai/)

I hope that these Newsletter showing my thinking behind some of the toughest decisions running my business are useful to you…

Let me know what you think and how you communicate prices in your business.
