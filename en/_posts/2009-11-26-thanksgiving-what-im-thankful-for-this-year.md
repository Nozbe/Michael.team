# Thanksgiving - what I'm thankful for this year


Although I'm not American and I live in Europe and we don't celebrate Thanksgiving at all, I can relate to this celebration anyway, because it's always nice to stop for a second and think what I'm thankful for...

1. **I'm thankful for my family**, and especially for my daughter who was born in January this year. And for my wife who gave birth to my baby girl... I have two exceptional females in my home and I love both of them with two totally different kind of love... and it's empowering and motivating... and rewarding.

2. **I'm thankful for my job** - I get to create a [web app](http://nozbe.com/) that makes a difference and touches lives of thousands of people in the world... and on top of that I get to [blog](http://michaelnozbe.com), [video blog](http://productiveshow.com) and help prepare a cool and free [magazine](http://productivemagazine.com)... and it all is lots of fun and keeps me going and growing.

3. **I'm thankful for my faith** - for the fact that Jesus Christ is my savior and I have nothing to fear, because he's present in my life everyday and if anything goes wrong or not as it's supposed to, I know he's by my side. It gives me great deal of confidence and a lot of power to do great things.

My life isn't a fairy tale. Which one is? I'm also having problems, issues, worries... but whenever I'm thinking about the three things that I get to be thankful for, I understand that none of the bad stuff matters, because thanks to these three reasons life is great and there is a reason for every day to be a Thanksgiving day.

_And what are you thankful for? How do you spend Thanksgiving?_
