# Embracing the MagSafe lifestyle

Apart from reducing the [size of the iPhone 12](/mini/) last year, Apple introduced a new type of accessories for the iPhone, which have to do with charging and magnets - [MagSafe](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/magsafe). While I was a little skeptical about this, I [ordered the MagSafe Wallet](https://michael.team/iphonescreen/#bonus-2-new-iphone-mini-cases---mujjo-and-apple-magsafe-wallet) and gave it a try. After a while I decided to go all in on MagSafe and embrace this new magnetic lifestyle.

## New MagSafe accessories for my iPhone

Here are the 5 accessories I decided to get for my iPhone. I've been testing them for more than a week or so and I must say that besides their price, I find using them brings me joy:

## 1. [iPhone 12 mini Leather Case with MagSafe](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHK73ZM/A/iphone-12-mini-leather-case-with-magsafe-productred) - (PRODUCT)RED ($59)

At home I usually use the iPhone Mini case-less but when I'm going away for a family weekend trip (that's all the travel I can do when [COVID-19](/covid) restrictions are in place) I prefer to have my iPhone covered. As my iPhone is black, my daughters advised me to get the red cover. As you can see on the photo below, the red-ish animation when the cover is applied is really delightful.

## 2. [iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLT3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-saddle-brown) - Baltic Blue ($59)

I've always loved the minimalist wallet for my iPhone. [Already back in 2013](https://sliwinski.com/iphone-wallet/) I started having my *minimalist wallet* attached to the iPhone. I later went through [cutting out wholes in a silicone cover](https://sliwinski.com/6pluslove) to finally embrace Mujjo wallet-case with the [iPhone X onwards](/newdevice/). I use it to store my ID, driver's license, physical credit card and one or two bills of cash. I don't carry any other wallet with me.

For the iPhone Mini [I got the Mujjo wallet first and the MagSafe wallet later](https://michael.team/iphonescreen/#bonus-2-new-iphone-mini-cases---mujjo-and-apple-magsafe-wallet). And I'm keeping the latter:

*Note:* Before I got the original one from Apple, I bought two different knock-offs from Amazon. Don't do it, their magnets are useless. Only the original Apple MagSafe wallet holds up well magnetically.

## 3. [MagSafe Duo Charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXF3AM/A/magsafe-duo-charger) ($129)

I'm a sucker for great, compact and travel-friendly accessories. So I gave in and bought the MagSafe Duo Charger. Yes, it's ridiculously overpriced. And it doesn't even come with a charging brick. But it's delightful. With one USB-C to Lightning cable I'm charging both my [iPhone](/iphone) and [Apple Watch](/applewatch).

## 4. [MagSafe Charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXH3AM/A/magsafe-charger) ($39)

While the above-mentioned Duo Charger is for travel and I keep it in my backpack at all times, I got a simple MagSafe *puck* for my bedroom (far away from my bed). Over there I have one micro-USB cable, two Lightning cables, one USB-C cable and the MagSafe. All to charge the iPads and iPhones in my household.

## 5. ESR Magnetic Wireless Car Charger ($35)

You can get it on [Amazon USA](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Magnetic-Attachment-Alignment/dp/B08HNBHSQV/?tag=sliwinski-20) or [Amazon Spain](https://www.amazon.es/ESR-Inalámbrico-MagSafe-Compatible-Alineación-Abrazadera/dp/B08HNBHSQV/?tag=sliwinski-20). Unlike the Belkin charger that is available on the Apple Store, this one both holds the iPhone very well and charges it at the same time. I had a chance to drive a few hundred miles last week with my iPhone mounted on it and no problems at all. It holds and charges perfectly.

## Bonus - the MagSafe accessories attach to my safe!

In the kitchen at home I have a small safe from Yale where I hold some spare cash, additional cards and car keys. The safe is made from metal, so the MagSafe accessories attach very well to it. This way I keep my MagSafe Wallet over there. When I leave home I just take it and clip it to the iPhone (which is very satisfying), take the car keys from the safe and off I go!

## MagSafe accessories are delightful but expensive…

No, the MagSafe lifestyle is not cheap. All of these gadgets add up to $321. And I'm planning to get two additional items: [Belkin BOOST↑CHARGE PRO 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPGA2ZM/A/belkin-boost↑charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-white) ($139) for my [home office](/office) and a [MagSafe Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/Mag-Safe-Ultra-Thin-Magnetic-Wireless-Powerbank/dp/B08QCZVL1P/?tag=sliwinski-20) (~$30).

In total I will have spent around $500 on MagSafe accessories. That's a lot. However, I'm hoping to use these for years to come not just with this [iPhone Mini](/mini) but also with the future iPhones.

> Delight and convenience cost money. But it's money well spent if you can spare it. Such small things bring you joy every day. And joy is priceless.
