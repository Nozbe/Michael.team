# Why “lessons learned” is better than just “lessons” - or how I edit my writing...

On the first day of this year [I wrote about my best nine IG photos.](https://sliwinski.com/2018bestnine) I really liked how the photos turned out so I decided to report on them and describe them briefly on this blog... and when I wrote and published the post I was happy that I’ve done just that... but _I wasn’t quite happy_ how it turned out. Now I know why:

## Reporting on facts is boring... reporting on what we’ve learned from these facts is much more valuable!

When I re-read the post I realized what was missing - my personal take on what happened - my conclusions. Things I’ve learned from these photos.

After all why am I writing stuff on this blog? Because I want to grow!

## I want to write more - to become a better person - and hopefully share some of these learnings with you!

[Two months ago I wrote about new habits](https://sliwinski.com/newhabits) I wanted to form... and I think I did. One of them was writing on this blog daily. Later I revised this goal to writing at least 5 blog posts a week (as in: weekday daily - I wanted to have an option to have a weekend off) and I mostly succeeded.

[If you look at the blog archive](https://sliwinski.com/archive), you’ll see I’ve been blogging a lot more than before. Almost daily.

Now here comes the **big why** - why I want to blog more frequently?

1. I want to have a way to **journal out in the public** and be able to easily (via an internet link) get back to these learnings or point others to them.
2. [Seth Godin thinks it’s good for me](https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/) and I agree with him :-)
3. I want to **become a better writer**. Now that I’ve published my new 10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity book... and more books to come.

## That’s why I need to focus on “learnings” when I blog over here

If what I post here is to serve me in the future and is to give value to others, I need to focus on what I’ve learned from things and how they impacted me. Not just on stating the facts. After all, I’m not a journalist, I’m a personal and team development guy. That’s what I’m trying to do here:

> To help you, your team and myself become a **better version** of ourselves.

## That’s the big why. That’s the reason I’ll write more in 2019.

Hope you’ll join me for the ride, [give me feedback](/contact) and help me spread the learnings from here. Thank you!
