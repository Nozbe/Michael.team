# Emotions in business are too often getting in the way of rational thinking... so keep giving yourself time to cool off... and read between the lines!

Weâ€™re humans and weâ€™re emotional. Apparently the notion is that women are more emotional then men, but by watching male fans react to whatâ€™s happening on a football stadium I have my doubts. Regardless, weâ€™re driven by emotions and I think too often we get the emotion get the better of us... and we donâ€™t take enough time to consult our rational part of brain.

## We should remember to make time and space to cool down!

Recently I had a little more time to reflect about some of my this yearâ€™s and last yearâ€™s decisions at the company and Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™ve been very emotional  over quite a few decisions in my company... and the worst part about it all is that the emotions stood in a way of me being a better leader of the company.

## Emotions will cloud your judgement.

Thatâ€™s why I think my problem was I let myself act emotionally without giving myself a little time to cool off and to think things through. This is the moment when emotions clouded my judgement of the situation.

## Emotions can be a compass ðŸ§­ 

When I felt emotionally impacted by someone on my team, what I instead should have done, is to cool down and analyze the situation:

- why am this makes me feel the way it does?
- why is the other person acting emotionally?
- whatâ€™s behind my emotions?
- whatâ€™s behind their emotions?

## Because thereâ€™s always a second, deeper meaning.

And thatâ€™s what a good leader should be up to - to uncover the second meaning behind the emotions. When someone acts emotionally it means they care about something, theyâ€™re passionate about something. As a leader I should be focused on finding what it REALLY is instead of reacting in a shallow way or acting offended. I should have known better.
