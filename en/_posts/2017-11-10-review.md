# Templates I use to review my day, week and quarter

Today is Friday (and [we’re doing Fridays](https://sliwinski.com/tgif/) differently at [Nozbe][n]) and it’s time for my [weekly review](https://sliwinski.com/weekly-review) so before I start just that, I decided to post this short reference to my best [NozbeHOW](https://Nozbe.how) templates which I regularly use to perform my reviews - you can use these templates even if you don’t have a Nozbe acccount:

## How I go about my day

This past week has been very productive for me because I stuck to my [Unschedule calendar and Pomodoro Technique](https://sliwinski.com/power-of-unschedule-and-pomodoro-technique) and especially I’ve used the "daily template" I wrote about on the [Nozbe blog](https://Nozbe.com/blog/unschedule).

**What I do:** Every morning [after I journal](https://sliwinski.com/journal) I open Nozbe and go to my templates and open my "Today" template to create a new project with today’s date as the name, like "10 Nov 2017" and I go about my day completing each 30min interval as another "pomodoro". At the end of the day I review this project and complete it.

## How I go about my Weekly Review

I’ve described the process in detail [here](https://sliwinski.com/weekly-review) but I basically create a new project from my template and give it a name like "45th weekly review" (where 45 is the number of the week in the year) and I go through the project:

## How I go about my Quarterly Off-site

According to advice from [Greg McKeown](https://sliwinski.com/greg-mckeown), the author of [Essentialism](https://sliwinski.com/essentialism), a book I recommend and [have read 3 times already](https://sliwinski.com/essentialist), every 3 months I do a "quarterly off-site", meaning for a day I step back and analyze my last quarter and plan my next one. I discussed this concept with [The Podcast][p] my co-host [on the 73rd episode of our show](/podcast-73). Again I use a template for that - I create a project from this one:

## Bonus - two additional templates for TGIF and Journaling

As I [journal every day](https://sliwinski.com/journal), once in the morning and once in the evening, I ask myself these questions:

Again, today is Friday, or [Thank Goodness It’s Friday](https://sliwinski.com/tgif/) here in my company, so here’s a rough schedule of today for everyone on my [Nozbe][n] team:

Hope you’ll find these templates helpful! Enjoy and share your ways of doing reviews and... Fridays!
