# The Podcast #116 - App of the Reunion

This week we’re publishing a special episode of [The Podcast][p] as we recorded a live episode in the same physical space - on our [Nozbe][n] reunion in the city of Wroclaw. We discuss the concept of #NozbeReunion and the key takeaways from this meeting. The conversation starts slow but picks up the pace half way through with a great ending!
