# Productive school? - interview with Mike St. Pierre - Productive! Magazine #23


It's September - the back-to-school time. This is a great occasion to talk to Mike St. Pierre - the tech and education guy, the President of Morris Catholic High School in Denville, blogger and podcaster. In the interview we talk about the way education and technology can work together, iPads replacing traditional school equipment and student books. Mike also shares his experiences and advises on productivity at schools.
