# New video with yours truly - how to get things done on your wrist [on: Nozbe.watch]

We've just released [Nozbe 2.1.8](https://nozbe.com/blog/218) with amazing new features like a native widget for Android and a totally redesigned app for the [Apple Watch](/applewatch). As you know I'm a big fan of this new gadget from Apple and I think my team did an amazing job with the [Nozbe app][Nozbe] for Watch so to celebrate it we launched a dedicated web site for this:

## [Nozbe.watch][s]

This site explains what is important in creating a "wrist app" and how we think you'll get more things done with Nozbe on your Apple Watch.

## Video showing off dictation, force touch and more:

To prove my point, we recorded a promo video with yours truly, showing the power of dictatation, force touch and much much more... what do you think?
