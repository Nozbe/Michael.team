# Productive! Magazine in Spanish gets an issue 2!

I'm so happy that the [Productive! Magazine][] family is growing. If you speak Spanish you will want to read this one. Thanks to the joint effort of my friends: [Augusto Pinaud][B] and [Josep María Martínez][A] we've got a second issue of the:

## [Productive! Magazine Español][C] with Ruben Alzola

## Free magazine, but the quality is there!

Apart from the interview there are 10 fantastic articles by the best Spanish speaking productivity experts  there, so everyone should be able to find something for themselves :-)

As always, our magazine is a very modern publication - you can [read it online][C] and also [get a free iPhone/iPad app][I] or [read on Android][G]. 

The cool thing about the Spanish edition is that my two friends picked up the rhythm and scheduled it to be a bi-monthly publication with close to 30 confirmed contributors for the future articles! The future of the Spanish speaking productivity space looks very promising!
