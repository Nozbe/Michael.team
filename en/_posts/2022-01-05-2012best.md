# Evergreen - decade-old blog posts that are still true today - best of 2012

A few days ago I posted a compilation of my [best posts of 2017](/2017best/) and I was surprised how well some of the 5-year old blog posts aged. Now as I exported old **sliwinski.com** blog posts from 2012, I was even more amazed how some of my writing after 10 years aged pretty well. I hope you'll agree with me and enjoy my best writing from a decade ago:

## Top 5 posts of 2012

Let's start with my favorite and subjectively the best posts of the year, that did stand the test of time or started a new trend that lasts a decade later:

- [**iFamily** - how I'm using iCloud setup with my spouse and family](/ifamily/) - I can't believe it still holds true in 2022.
- [**#iPadOnly** era has begun](/ipad-as-my-main-computer-prologue/) when I got a new iPad 3 with Retina display and started working on it full time and was blogging about it (more below)
- [**Stand-up!** How to work standing (check out this video)](/im-still-standing-my-latest-video-show/) - I keep working like this [to this day](/office22/)
- [**Grand home office** setup for 2012](/office12/) - my first [home office](/office/) that incorporates stand-up desk, dedicated iPad space and built-in document shredder.
- [**Un-schedule** and pomodoro](/power-of-unschedule-and-pomodoro-technique/) - it started my quest for a perfect workweek.

These were by far my most popular or most transformational posts. But in total 2012 was very fruitful and there's more to explore:

## Essays on running a business

In 2012 I celebrated [5 years](/5nozbe/) of running [Nozbe][n] and I wrote about many aspects of this business:
