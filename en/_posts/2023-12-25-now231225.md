# On December 25 I amâ€¦

Itâ€™s Christmas Day! Iâ€™m back with my family celebrating Christmas, my parents today celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary and Iâ€™m taking 2 weeks off to review the year and prepare myself for a challenging 2024!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* After coining the [core values of Nozbe](/nozbe-values/) I finally figured out the positioning of [Nozbe][n] after diving deep into [Sethâ€™s Marketing book and course](/marketing): *Nozbe helps SMART business owners achieve work-life balance in a simple way!* Who is a "SMART" business owner? Glad you asked! More answers soonâ€¦
* Iâ€™m getting ready to start off the year with a brand new [10-steps to productivity webinar](/control-of-your-tasks/) for these SMART business owners (and their teams)! January and Ferbruary will be very exciting this way!
* Weâ€™ve doubled our MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) of the new [Nozbe][n] last year and next year Iâ€™m planning to double it again! Lots of [essentialism](/essentialist) in our marketing and sales efforts will be required. Iâ€™m very excited!

## â€¦and when I can, I'm also:

* Iâ€™m creating more and more [Shortcuts](/shortcuts) for my business use. Two Iâ€™m thinking of releasing: *Threads Master* (which I use to publish Threads ðŸ§µ on Twitter, LinkedIn and Mastodon) and *PresenterCut* (for preparing presentations from [Markdown](/markdown))
* My web site will officially go open-source next year
* Iâ€™m getting ready to revisiting my [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org/) and finally finishing this draft and publishing it. The world needs it for the hybrid future!

## â€¦and privately:

* For the last four months I had 4 kids at home - our friendsâ€™ son came to stay with us as exchange student. It was fun to have a son for a change (I am a father to 3 daughters) and a 16-year old at that. Family of 6 was fun for a while and he integrated himself in the family very nicely.
* Iâ€™ve optimized my travel [pouch](/pouch) and Iâ€™ll soon publish the contents of my [backpack](/backpack). With the [iPhone 15 Pro](/iphone15) I donâ€™t need many more Lightning accessories as USB-C is the way! *USB-C all things!*
* Iâ€™ve finished the year doing [lots of sports](/sports) and Iâ€™ve reached most my sports goals this year. Iâ€™m getting ready for my next [triathlon](/tri15) races next year!

P.S. The photo illustrates a model of a car I crafted when we had a crafting workshop on one of our [Nozbe reunions](/reunion/) last year. When you're staring at a computer screen all day, crafting is the way to change pace, reflect and take your mind off things.
