# The 10 Top Distinctions between Millionaires and the Middle Class by Keith Cameron Smith - book of the week


I've mentioned this book several times in my blog posts. Out of all Audibile books I bought, this one was one of the first. I don't remember why I was attracted to this book (I think it was its high Audible review score) but I bought it, listened to it (and it's just 2 hours short!) and loved it. While the title may sound a little cocky, make sure to check it out - you'll learn a lot from this book. I've read this book 4 times already and every time I learn something new:

## The author self-published the book

The cool think about this book is that it's authentic - the author based the 10 distinctions on his own experiences and the ones from his friends. He wanted to spread his message so much that he self-published the book and it became a huge hit through the word of mouth... and then the big publisher bought the rights to it. A success story in itself.

## The top distinctions are the mindset changes

When I told my wife about this book, she looked at me and asked me if I thought I was Donald Trump or something... but I explained that it's not the point of this book - the whole clue is to think differently - to change your mindset - only then you can learn something new, become financially independent and live a happy life.

I've already explained in many [other](http://michaelnozbe.com/just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should) [blog](http://michaelnozbe.com/feed-your-curiosity-try-things-out-learn-grow) [posts](http://michaelnozbe.com/labor-day-a-reason-to-celebrate-love-for-work) how the mindset change of pursuing what I loved made me happy. Many people don't make the shift and they say they need to work to earn money and only then they can be happy. They can't understand that you can love your work and do what you love for a living. The same mindset changes are shown in this book.

## Distinction 7 - Millionaires take risks: [Decisions and Consequences - taking calculated risks](http://michaelnozbe.com/decisions-and-consequences-taking-calculated)

In my other blog post I already mentioned one of the distinctions - Millionaires take calculated risks. It's so true and it helped me many times over to make the correct decision. It's only one of the 10 distinctions and it helped me so much.

Over the next weeks I'll be quoting more from this book and I'll be exploring more of the 10 distinctions in depth with real-world examples from my life, so stay tuned. Meanwhile I really recommend you read this book - open your mind and try to embrace these distinctions.
