# 12 new shorts: health, donating blood, core values, lego and my several takes on meetings!

I've been busy with my [New YouTube Channel][y] over the last month and since [my 10 first videos](/channel/) and [videos about Taiwan](/taiwan/) I've posted more short takes and a long video [about meetings](/meetings). Here are my recent 12 shorts (each is less than 1 minute, so check them out!):

## Feeling sick

When you're working in a hybrid mode or [#NoOffice](/nooffice) then you can work even if you have a mild cold and be pretty productive:

## Active weekends

If you want to be healthy and productive, you need to make sure you have a [balanced life](/life), where there's time for active weekends:

## Donating blood

Health of others is also important, so I encourage you to donate blood. Here's how and why I do it:

## Core values

At [Nozbe][n] we have established our [4 CORE VALUES](/nozbe-values/), here's why:

## Lego

I love [lego](/lego) and here's why it helps me with my [productivity](/productivity):

{% include videos.html id="4r3i1RgFF40" %}

## Happy users

We've launched a new web site at [Nozbe][n] where we showcase our [happy users](https://nozbe.com/users?c=michaelteam):

{% include videos.html id="IrZJU_EU0EA" %}

## Michaels

As [mentioned before](/michaels) I've been playing with the idea of "Two Michaels" to **show change** and I think I'm getting to the right concept with [the "Meetings" video](/meetings). Here are both personas:

## Meetings

I sliced the [Meetings video](/meetings) into several shorts, starting with a question: *How many meetings do you have?*

{% include videos.html id="bSO6dPqGgBU" %}

## Rules of Meetings

At [Nozbe][n] we believe that Meetings should be [regular, optional and well prepared](https://NoOffice.org/meetings):

{% include videos.html id="45OgqmcOFKw" %}

## Prepared meetings

Here's what I mean when I say that meetings should be *well prepared*:

{% include videos.html id="s-GHIHIoIs0" %}

## Channel trailer

Based on my [first video on the channel](/channel/) I created this short trailer:

{% include videos.html id="obovQpdPwc8" %}

## Other Michael

This is the ["other Michael"](/michaels) I created for my channel:

{% include videos.html id="6ejMyId_UlI" %}

## Subscribe and share!

My **[YouTube Channel is still new][y]** so I encourage you to subscribe or share my videos or just this page with the videos embedded.

I really love it how this short video format is helping me distill the message to bare minimum and be both helpful and useful in less than a minute! Do you agree?
