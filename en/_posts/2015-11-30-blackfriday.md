> "It's all about timing. The Thanksgiving weekend is the last weekend of November so if you choose to upgrade to Nozbe PRO now you have December to actually sum up your year and prepare for a great next year. You have a whole month to get to know our tool, get all of our apps and start getting organized."

> "Having our sale at the end of November gives us a chance to really show you what we've been doing all this year. The new Nozbe 2.6 with Nozbe.how shared templates, a new version of Nozbe almost every month, faster apps for Android and iOS, as well as great new apps for new platforms like Apple Watch or Windows Phone."

> "Seeing people like you "voting with your wallet" for our productivity solution (sometimes even 3 new orders in 10 seconds, just like on the picture above!), makes us even more excited to serve you even better next year and for the years to come. We're close to 9 years running Nozbe and it still feels we're just getting started!"
