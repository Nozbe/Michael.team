# Garry Kasparov on Ted explaining the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦 in 15 minutes

In my childhood I remember admiring [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov), the best chess player of all time. Now I see him actively *engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the preservation of freedom and democracy*. You should [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63) but first I recommend you watch his amazing [talk on Ted](https://www.ted.com/talks/garry_kasparov_stand_with_ukraine_in_the_fight_against_evil): *”Stand with Ukraine in the fight against evil”* which he gave earlier this month - it’s only 15 minutes and it’s absolutely worth your time:

Over the last 50 days of the War in Ukraine I was struggling to [explain it to people in the west](/politico/). I wrote how [bad things happen when good people do nothing](/nothing/). I recorded a video showing how even small businesses [like mine][n] can [do something actively to sanction Russia](/nowar/).

In his succinct speech GaGarrys explaining to everyone that sometimes in life things are black and white. Good and evil. And to keep our freedom we need to actively fight for it.

Please watch it. Listen to Garry. We must be #UnitedWithUkraine 🇺🇦 because they're not only fighting for their country - they're fighting for the freedom of all of us!
