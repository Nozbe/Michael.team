# On Nozbe blog - how about giving away $15 for each new team?

On [Nozbe][n] blog I published a short blog post explaining how we’ve made more improvements to the [Affiliate/Referral](https://nozbe.com/refer) program. Now when you recommend Nozbe to others, you’re spreading #NozbeLove ❤️ with $15 in free credit!

## Why $15 in free credit?

> When we celebrated 15 years of Nozbe we ran a special promo - that just for signing up for a new Nozbe account or migrating your Nozbe Personal account to the new Nozbe, you’d get an extra credit of $15 which you could then spend on extending or upgrading your Nozbe subscription. It was a pretty great deal. In fact, it was so good, that we decided to make it permanent for everyone who is recommending Nozbe to a friend.

I believe it makes our [Affilite / Referral Program](https://nozbe.com/refer/) much better than before. Not only do we offer 25% commissions, we also offer a unique incentive for people to go through recommendations and not sign up directly on the Nozbe web site.
