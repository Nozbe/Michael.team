# How to correctly use a computer - the new iPad Pro with the new keyboard

Just saw the launch of the new iPad Pro and I love it. I’m not sure I’m getting the iPad itself, as it’s just slightly better than what I’ve got now, but the keyboard is great - the trackpad support, the multi-angle support, the elevated view.... the whole thing is amazing (and expensive) and compatible with my current iPad. And the new ad is slick:

What do you think? Are you getting the new Pro? Or just the keyboard?
