# 15th olympic-distance triathlon completed - let‚Äôs keep swimming, cycling and running!

When back in [2014 I tried a sprint-distance triathlon](/triathlon/) I didn‚Äôt suspect I‚Äôd stick with this kind of race for so long. Later that year I tried my first olympic-distance triathlon which is 1.5km swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, 40km cycling üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and 10km running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - all sports one after another - and I loved it and started doing such races regularly! Three years ago I [completed 11th race](/tri11/) and yesterday - 8 years from starting my triathlon adventure - I finished my 15th olympic-distance race and 17th triathlon overall. I‚Äôve shared many of [my thoughts on triathlons in my last post](/tri11/) and described [tracking it with Apple Watch](/triwatch/) but I have new conclusions that, if you're into sports and gear, you might find interesting:

## Consistently signing up for a race keeps me motivated!

15 triathlons in 8 years makes an average of just below 2 per year, which means that depending on the year, I was competing in 1-3 races. That's at least 1 triathlon a year. And I really like this cadence. Signing up for a race keeps me motivated to stay in shape.

There were times when I was doing lots of sports ([like 2014](/2014/)), when I completed [all activity rings regularly](/shape/) or when [I wasn't in my best shape](/undertrained/).

This year I wasn't really doing well. I was struggling with my weight picking up and as I was [busy launching new Nozbe](/nozbe15/) I didn't find enough time to do regular training. However, as the date of May 15th was closing on me, I realized I needed to get going, pronto!

I started making time for training. I'm 50 days into my move streak on [Apple Watch](/applewatch/), I signed up for local pool to swim again and I began cycling more ([with some adventures](/accident/)). The imminent date of a triathlon race forced me to do something and be ready. Now that I've done it, I'm planning on doing a race in October to make the average of 2 triathlons a year a reality. And to keep the stay-in-shape momentum going!

## Having a group of friends doing sports doesn't let you give up!

Yes, I did sign up for a race, but I could have just said I wasn't ready. After all, I'm not in my best shape (I achieved my personal best in 2017!) so there's always a perfect excuse of "maybe not this year" waiting to be used.

But I'm not alone. I have a WhatsApp "Triathlon Team" group where we discuss sports and coordinate outings. It's a small group of 12 people but we keep on cheering one another all the time. And 4 of us signed up for this race, so it was really hard for me to back down and not compete (as pictured above from left: Jo, Sophie and Nick).

This social accountability works. Not only because I'd feel ashamed to back out, but mostly because thanks to their support I know I can do it. We help each other believe we can! üí™ 

## Doing three sports is amazing!

After all these years I still love the fact that any day I can practice one of these sports. When I don't feel like running, I go for a swim. Or take my bike out for a spin. I have three options depending on my mood, time or weather conditions.

And overall, my body is staying in shape stressing different muscles depending on the discipline.

And when I don't feel like any of that, I just [play tennis](/tennis/) ü§™

## Apple Watch Series 6 has plenty of battery to last an entire race

Using [Apple Watch series 4](/triwatch/) was pretty OK but the battery barely lasted for the entire race. When I got [Series 5](/watch5/) with always-on display, I noticed when doing sports that the battery drained faster because of the new screen. The same happened to my Series 6 which I got nearly 2 years ago.

The solution was to tweak the settings.

Before I start the race I do the following:

- **Turn OFF Cellular** - I won't be calling anyone anyway when racing!
- **Turn OFF Wireless** - I don't need this for GPS to work
- **Turn ON "Theater mode"** - This way the screen is not always-on but it only wakes up when I tap on it.

I launch the [Tri Tracker app](https://myswimpro.com/blog/2018/06/04/triathlon-tracker-race-workout-tracker-apple-watch/) and the watch collects all the data in the background and is not wasting battery on things that don't matter during the race. When I need to check my time or speed, I just tap on the screen and see how I'm doing.

And no, I don't have any additional training trackers. I use [Apple Watch](/applewatch/) during all my trainings and races.

## There's no excuse for being out of shape!

There really isn't. We need to make time to train. Not everyone has to be a triathlete, but I like being one and I'm happy that after all these years I still can do an olympic-distance triathlon and that keeps me motivated to keep staying in shape, despite [being in my forties](/birthday/).
