# My thoughts have been replaced by "Hamilton" lyrics‚Ä¶

I love musicals and I'm a huge fan of the [Hamilton musical](https://hamiltonmusical.com/) since I saw it first in London on West-end in 2019. Later it came to Disney+ with the original cast and the brilliant [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.linmanuel.com/) (see trailer below) and we've been having regular screenings with friends and family in our home. Later we took our entire family (including our three daughters) to see the show again on West-end in London in 2022. But that's not all, as both my wife and me speak German, we even travelled to Hamburg in Germany, to [attend a German-version of Hamilton](https://www.hamburg.com/visitors/explore/musicals/hamilton-22366) last year. Our entire family is crazy about this show. [We listen to the entire soundtrack in the car](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cuyMAneJqms&list=PLK1wqzZ8S6Rxh4Lird7421tcLNvtpD8uQ&index=1). And my eldest daughter got herself a shirt that says: *"My thoughts have been replaced by Hamilton lyrics"* which inspired me to write this post:

## Hamilton lyrics replaced my thoughts?

In our family this is exactly what happened. We quote Hamilton constantly and here are some of the quotes (more-less in order of appearance) that we use when we talk to each other. Yep, we're Hamilton geeks and we're not ashamed of ourselves.

That's why the [Hamilton Musical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)) received a Pulitzer Prize for writing. It's just a great musical with great lyrics, amazing songs and very upbeat music and no wonder mine and my family's thoughts have been replaced by these lyrics and are with us every day‚Ä¶
