# On July 25 `25 I am…

…enjoying a two-week Motorhome/RV holidays with my family, recharging after a very busy first half of 2025!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We approved the roadmap for this year and the next which will help us guide product decisions
* We hired two new team members to help us execute on this roadmap. It’s good to have ‘new blood’ with new ideas
* We’re exploring new ways of promoting our app. Some of our experiments are promising but others have failed…

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m testing iOS26 on an iPhone SE (2022) and can’t wait to play with Liquid Glass on my main phone. 
* After I’m back from this vacation I’ll install iPadOS26 to test these new iPad multitasking features.

## …and privately:

* I love the motorhome lifestyle. We planned a holiday in Sweden 🇸🇪 but as we saw great weather in Norway 🇳🇴 we went there spontaneously and loved the Norwegian fiords with sunshine ☀️ 
* I’m happy my entire family still enjoyed traveling like this and that this has been our yearly tradition for the last 6 years!
