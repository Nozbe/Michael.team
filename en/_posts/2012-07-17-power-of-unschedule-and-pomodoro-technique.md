# Power of Unschedule and Pomodoro Technique

I've written time and time again on my blog about how I love the [Pomodoro Technique](/pomodoro-technique-and-other-simple-ways-to-g) (do something for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break) and recently, after reading ["The Now Habit" I love the concept of an Unschedule](/the-now-habit-by-neil-fiore-overcoming-procra) calendar. In this post I'll show you how they work together beautifully to help me improve and get things done.

## The basic concepts of "Unschedule" calendar

The idea is this:

  * You divide your calendar into 30-minute-slots and leave them blank.
  * You put "meetings" and all the calendar-like events that have to happen at certain time (I use "red" color for this)
  * You put cool things you want to do (like training, watching youtube... small rewards you want to have - the cool stuff - I use "red" or "orange" for this)
  * You leave everything else blank and fill it out once you've done with your next half-an-hour slot and you "check in" what you've done in the last half an hour.

So the concept is really cool - you only schedule the "cool stuff" and the "must-happen" stuff. And you fill out the blanks as they go.

This way you know how much "blanks" you have until next "must-be" thing happens and you can "schedule rewards" for yourself, like watching some cool youtube videos for 30 minutes or reading. Or gym.

## Good rule of thumb: Schedule 2 hours of work and 30 minutes of "reward" - meaning - put a "reward" or "meeting" every 2 hours and leave the rest blank. Your work-day won't be boring and you'll get a lot more done in the 2-hour blocks you have.

## The Pomodoro Techinque fits nicely with it

This fits perfectly as this technique means 25 minutes of "focused" work and 5 minutes of resting. I normally use a traditional "kitchen timer" as I like the "old-school" touch it brings to my home office. Although on my Mac I use a great new app called [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com/) by a talented Polish developer. There are also "pomodoro" apps for the iPhone and iPad. Again, I prefer to use the old-school timer or the Mac app.

## Together these techniques make me more productive... and fit!

Finally I manage to schedule "gym time" which was very hard for me before (I'm busy all of the time)... I just know I get to work 2 more hours and then I need to go to the gym, or run. Finally I'm actually doing workouts every single day. Same goes to reading. Apart from audio-reading (while running) I'm also catching up with blogs and old-school books as I schedule my reading time.

## My work is more focused

I actually print an [Unschedule calendar](/pdf/unschedule.pdf) every week and put it on the wall and use a ballpoint pen in different colors to fill it up. This way I can see the blanks, I can see when I slack off... and when I had a great and productive day... and how much time I really have ahead of me each day.

Once half an hour is gone and I worked on something I put it in one or two words in BLUE color. If I slacked off, I use the BLACK color and write honestly what I've been doing... or not doing.

## When you fall... you dust off every 30 minutes

The cool thing of the Unschedule is that even if I have a "slower slot" of time and I put "nothing" in black, I can dust off and try again in the next half-an-hour slot. I just don't have hours of a slow day anymore, because one view of my Unschedule calendar motivates me to shake things up and start getting things done.

## Give it a try, you'll love it. Pomodoro and Unschedule work great together!

_Have you ever tried either of these techniques? Do you like them? Did they work / or not / for you?_
