## Home office!

Home office ideas - I recently finished up [preparing my home office for 2022](/office22), with a great [zoom video conferencing gear](/streaming/). I've even set up a corner for my new [iPad 13" Pro](/ipad13pro) and the decade-old [Thunderbolt Display](/display/).

## My book

My book - [It's All About Passion](/passion/) - which I sent you as you subscribed to this Newsletter is now available to [read online free](/passion/intro) - and I think that after 7 years it still stands the test of time.

If you know anyone who could benefit from an inspiring story about passion and actually 7 different types of passion, please send forward them this email or send them this link: [Michael.team/passion](/passion)

Thanks for hanging in with me and I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy and above all, healthy, New Year!
