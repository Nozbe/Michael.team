# No Office FM #37: Mighty Fridays (or 4-day workweek) in Nozbe

Welcome to the episode #37 of my podcast about working remotely with Rafal, [Nozbe][n]'s VP of Product. We record one week earlier than usual to talk about [War in Ukraine](https://nozbe.com/ukraine) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ and what we can do about it, as well as our [Mighty Fridays](https://nozbe.com/friday/) - our approach to a 4-day workweek at [Nozbe][n].
