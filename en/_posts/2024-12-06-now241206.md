# On December 6 `24 I am…

…Just finished a **Black Friday** promo at [Nozbe][n] and we’re getting ready for another big push - this Autumn has been very busy!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* We’ve had our most successful **Black Friday** offer ever for the [new Nozbe][n] - still didn’t beat the ones in the past for **Nozbe Personal** but getting there.
* Preparing to rename old Nozbe once again. This time from **Nozbe Personal** to simply **Nozbe Classic** to really communicate that this is the old/legacy version of our app and the new one is the way to go. Finally.
* After letting go of 3 people this summer and 4th person leaving, our smaller team of 14 is re-grouping nicely and I think we’re in a good place now. As per our [Nozbe values](/nozbe-values) we have doubled down on **simplicity** in our processes and feedback loops.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’ve finally reviewed all my [Shortcuts](/shortcuts) and updated a special page called [Cuts](/cuts) where I post links to all the Shortcuts I am and have been using.
* I’ve prepared the new version of [Watchnotes](/watchnotes), [Clipboard](/clipboard) and [Journal](/journal) and I’m about to release all of them in the upcoming weeks. These are significant updates and compatibility improvements with iOS18.
* I’m reading Seth’s book **This is Strategy** to get ready for the new year. I want to make sure we finally experience a hockey-stick growth our [Nozbe][n] deserves next year!

## …and privately:

* I’m trying to double down on [sports](/sports) as I have been pretty sloppy this year. I want to get back to my best shape ever.
* I’m finishing off several small projects - [LEGO](/lego) set of Ferrari, improvements to my [Home office](/office) and some other home automations.
* I’ve updated [my backpack and tech pouch](/backpack) with all the latest gear I’m using and finally decided which [Anker charger](/anker) I’m gonna be using.
