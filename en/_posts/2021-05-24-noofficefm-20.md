# No Office FM #20: How To Achieve The Work-Life Balance According To Michael Hyatt

Welcome to the episode #20 of my podcast about working remotely with Rafal, [Nozbe][n]'s VP of Product. What a blast talking to my guru and mentor, Michael Hyatt. I feel like he’s an older brother to me :-) I knew how busy he was launching his new book “How to win at work and succeed at life” and still he found the time to talk to me live on the podcast, to celebrate [my birthday](/forty2). It was also our first ever truly live video episode of the [NoOffice.FM](/noofficefm) podcast. Check it out, you won’t regret it!
