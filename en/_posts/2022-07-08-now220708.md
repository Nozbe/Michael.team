## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m finally finishing off the [#NoOffice book](/nooffice) and I’m preparing the launch of the Polish edition for this fall and English edition for next year
* I’ve just updated my [journaling app](/journal) using Siri Shortcuts so that you all can get the benefits of daily journaling easily
* I’ve set up a permanent [blog post about the status of War in Ukraine](/fckptn) so that I can keep track on what’s going on there 🇺🇦 ✌️ 

## …and privately:

* I’ve just completed my [15th Olympic-distance triathlon](/tri15)
