# It's all your fault! Even when it isn't!

Just the other day I re-read my [blame blog post][b] which I wrote 2 years ago because I was talking to a friend of mine who's an entrepreneur and he needed a lesson. He was blaming everyone for his failures. For his problems. For his lack of success and traction. And it was all wrong because the reality is that it's all his fault. All of it:

When something wrong or bad is happening to or in your business you as the CEO and founder should take the blame. All of it. And based on that you should apologize to yourself, your team, and then fix it.

Too many people nowadays don't do that and use all of their energy to find a scapegoat. This is not right. This is not a way to go. This will not help you avoid the problem in the future.

Of course it's easier to blame the economy, the circumstances, the environment or a co-worker. There will always be someone to blame. And it better not be you, right!?

Wrong!

Yet I advise you to do the contrary. Take the blame right away. Don't focus on finding a scapegoat but focus on finding a solution instead.

Take the blame. Find a solution. Move on. That's it. Good luck!
