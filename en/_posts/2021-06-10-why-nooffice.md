# Why Nozbe has no office and how we work (on Nozbe blog)

Soon we’re starting to take signups for our brand new “Remote Teamwork” course. We’re kicking it all off with a great article about why [#NoOffice](/nooffice) work is great and how your company can leverage it to be more efficient and more productive. Magda has written this one and apparently she’s also experimenting with voice over acting as she also reads it for you as well, check it out below or [Read it on the Nozbe blog ℹ️](https://nozbe.com/blog/why-nooffice/)

Some quotes from this article:

> If there’s one positive thing about the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s the fact that it has significantly helped legitimize work from home as actual work. Remote work will lift productivity by 5% in Post-Pandemic US Bloomberg announced. The HBR research showed that knowledge workers are more productive from home. They take responsibility for their own schedules and do 50% more activities through personal choice and only half as many because someone else asked them to.

And also [what I pointed out earlier](/flexibility):

> Apple employees pushing back against a policy that would require them to return to the office in September 2021 emphasised that embracing remote work is paramount for the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts: "For inclusion and diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive."

Lots of good tips in the article, highlighting the importance of the right hires and [trust](https://NoOffice.org/trust/):

> When hiring, it’s worthwhile to explain to the candidates what the remote team is all about, emphasize the importance of mutual trust and check how they get organized on a daily basis. The team itself will very quickly asses whether a new colleague can work from home efficiently or not. If he or she becomes a bottleneck, they won’t be willing to continue cooperating with him or her. That’s why you don’t need to worry about employees cheating and pretending to do their job. Dishonesty will be revealed and rebuffed naturally.
