# Roll the Dice Shortcut for your iPhone or Apple Watch!

A long time ago [I built a page to roll the dice](/rolling/) so that I can pull it up and use it when I'm playing games with my daughters and for some reason we have misplaced the dice: **[michael.team/dice](/dice)** - but recently as I was playing more with [Siri Shortcuts](/shortcuts) I decided to build a Shortcut that could let you roll the dice on your [iPhone](/iphone), [iPad](/ipadonly/), [Mac](/computers/) or even an [Apple Watch](/applewatch/). And [here it is][d]:

## Roll the dice on your iOS device!

Just get this Shortcut and install it on your iOS or Mac device:

### [Dice Shortcut 🎲][d]

Save it and run it and you'll have an option to choose if you want to roll one 🎲 or two 🎲🎲 dice and then the Shortcut will loop until you hit "X" to cancel it.

On [Apple Watch](/ultra) it works a little slowly sometimes, but it does work. On the iPhone or iPad it works great.

[Install the Shortcut][d] and enjoy playing board games with your family over Christmas 🎄🎁
