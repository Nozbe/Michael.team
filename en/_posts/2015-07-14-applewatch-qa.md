# Apple Watch Q&A with Space Grey unboxing and Nozbe for Watch demo - Productive! Show #96


Unboxing on Periscope again, this time with my personal review of the Apple Watch as I've had it for 1,5 months. I'm giving my "old" Apple Watch to my wife as I'm unboxing and getting the new Space Grey 38mm one. I'm a fairly short guy with small wrist, so 38 is a lot better for me than the 42 watch - I tried both sizes in the Apple Store. In this video I take viewers questions and demo some Watch apps, like also our very own Nozbe app.

Question: Did you get an Apple Watch? Which one? What do you think?

Please post your comments below, thanks!
