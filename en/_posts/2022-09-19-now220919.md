# On September 19 '22 I amâ€¦

Iâ€™m back at work after many weeks of vacation time! Excited to finish this year with a bang!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Iâ€™m working on a completely new Marketing Strategy based on what weâ€™ve learned this past year âœ…
* Iâ€™m figuring out how to write Nozbe USP (Unique Selling Proposition) in a way thatâ€™s really meaningful and a little weird ðŸ¤ª
* Nozbe is finally an LLC (Limited Liability Company, in Polish: spÃ³Å‚ka z ograniczonÄ… odpowiedzialnoÅ›ciÄ…) and this also means many administrative tasks!

## â€¦and when I can, I'm also:

* Iâ€™ve just published a brand new [Journaling and Planning](/journal) Siri Shortcut for everyone to use - [also in Polish](/pl/planowanie)
* Iâ€™m postponing finishing off the [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org/) for next year. No time for it now. Need to focus working on [Nozbe][n].

## â€¦and privately:

* Iâ€™m trying to get in a better shape. Iâ€™ve resumed my triathlon trainings and Iâ€™m on a pretty strict [slow carb diet](/slow-carb-diet) now.
* Iâ€™m getting ready to travel for next [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion) - this time in Szczecin!
* My middle daughter - Emilia - turns 10 today. Now my girls are 13, 10 and 6! They are growing too fast!
