# On September 19 I am…

I’m back at work after many weeks of vacation time! Excited to finish this year with a bang!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* I’m working on a completely new Marketing Strategy based on what we’ve learned this past year
* I’m figuring out how to write Nozbe USP (Unique Selling Proposition) in a way that’s really meaningful and a little weird
* Nozbe is finally an LLC (Limited Liability Company, in Polish: spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością) and this also means many administrative tasks!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’ve just published a brand new [Journaling and Planning](/journal) Siri Shortcut for everyone to use - [also in Polish](/pl/planowanie)
* I’m postponing finishing off the [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org/) for next year. No time for it now.

## …and privately:

* I’m trying to get in a better shape. I’ve resumed my triathlon trainings and I’m on a pretty strict [slow carb diet](/slow-carb-diet) now.
* I’m getting ready to travel for next [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion) - this time in Szczecin!
