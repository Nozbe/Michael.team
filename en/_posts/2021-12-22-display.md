# 7 lives of a decade-old trusty Apple Thunderbolt Display

On the last episode of No Office FM podcast my co-host, Rafal, asked me about a lonely display hanging on the wall behind me. He didn't know why I had this display there. I had no good answer, until the weekend came and I figured it out. I gave my good old trusty, almost-10-year old [Apple Thunderbolt Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display) another, actually seventh, life! Just check out its history:

## Life #1. External display for the MacBook Air

10 years ago, [in December 2011](https://www.instagram.com/p/Xzi-C/), when [MacBook Air was still my main computer](https://sliwinski.com/my-first-mac/) and I only started flirting with becoming [#iPadOnly](/ipadonly/), I bought this display to provide me with much needed additional screen real estate. You can see it in action [in the episode #42](https://sliwinski.com/still-standing-stand-up-desk-and-productivity-show-42/) of my [Productivity Show](/show/). In fact, initially I used this display's [packaging as my stand-up desk!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Z6Zaf/)

## Life #2. Main display for the Mac Mini

Later in 2012 when [I started embracing the #iPadOnly lifestyle](https://sliwinski.com/ipad-as-my-main-computer-prologue), I got a [Mac Mini as my home office computer](https://sliwinski.com/part-16-why-i-still-need-a-mac-mini-ipad-as-m) and this display was [perfect to rock this setup](https://www.instagram.com/michaelsliwinski/p/TaoP8VJ_WR/).

## Life #3. Additional display for the MacBook Pro

In 2013 I caved and got myself a [retina MacBook Pro 13"](https://sliwinski.com/my-last-pc) as *the last personal computer I'd ever buy or need*. I hooked up this display to it to extend my available screen real estate.

## Life #4. Additional display for the iMac 5K

Two years later I caved again, and got myself an [iMac 5K](/imac/) which I have in my home office [to this day](/office22/). Contrary to the iMac 5K screen, the Thunderbolt Display's resolution wasn't retina, but I still loved having an [additional display on the side](https://www.instagram.com/michaelsliwinski/p/4L_jT0J_RR/).

## Life #5. Back to the MacBook Pro for my wife

At the same time my wife started flirting with [#NoOffice lifestyle](/nooffice/) as her bosses let her do *occasional teleworking*, meaning she could work once a week from home. I set her up a nice home office in the corner of our bedroom with my old MacBook Pro and this display hooked into it. As she's a lawyer and works on documents all day long, [she really appreciated this setup.](https://www.instagram.com/p/7NoMySp_WQ/)

## Life #6. Back to my iMac 5K.

In 2019 my wife's employer stopped supporting employee-owned Macs for teleworking and gave my wife a ThinkPad. I got her an external 27" 4K display from LG so the Thunderbolt Display was unemployed again. In the meantime my eldest daughter took ownership of the MacBook Pro and I hooked up the display to the iMac again, creating a [special recording corner](/office21/).

To do that, I had to buy a special adapter to be able to hang the display on the wall mount.

## Life #7. External display for the 13" iPad Pro

Today we're on the seventh life of this trusty display. Using a special [Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter) (which costs 50 bucks!) I managed to hook up my glorious [iPad Pro 13"](/ipad13pro/) to it and use it as an external display.

I know that the iPadOS external display support is far from great, but this setup gives me three major benefits:

**First - bigger perspective.** When I want to look at what I'm doing from like a bigger perspective, I can just take a look up at the display. I know it's not retina but it's so far away from me that the screen is still perfectly readable but I don't see the pixels anyway.

**Second - watching station.** When I open a video clip it does use the whole screen (see photo above) and the display's external speakers which is a great viewing experience for my home office.

**Third - more screen real estate.** Some apps I use do support the external screen pretty well. Like MindNode or LumaFusion. Here's hoping Apple will finally take external display support more seriously in the iPadOS16.

## Giving additional lives to tech gadgets is tight!

Over the last decade this display has lived seven different lives and is still kicking! This is a great testament to this monitor's build quality (congrats Apple!) and versatility. Yes, I had to buy an expensive dongle to connect it to my [iPad](/ipadonly/) but I didn't need to buy a completely new monitor to be enjoying more screen real estate. It's a win-win-win all around.

And how do you recycle your old computer gadgets?
