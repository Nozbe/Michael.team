# Audiobook of the week: Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath


I have a long history with this book. I actually bought it like 2 years ago as a physical book and took it with me on virtually every trip I did... and never managed to read this book. What can I say... I'm a lousy reader... but good listener.

That's why after I "read" in an audio kind of way[ Chip and Dan's second book, Switch](http://michaelnozbe.com/book-review-switch-by-heath-brothers-a-positi), I decided to just purchase the audio version of "Made to Stick" and listen to it. And boy was it great:

> Get this book on: [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V0QVY6?tag=sliwinski-20) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400064287?tag=sliwinski-20)

Authors investigate why some ideas "stick" in our heads and are being passed on throughout centuries and others don't. Why some ideas are "brilliant" and others not.

## Is it possible to engineer a "brilliant" and "sticky" idea? Chip and Dan say it's do-able.

Here's how. The idea needs to have these 6 features. Preferably all of them, in order to stick around:

- **S - Simple** - it's gotta be simple - KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid! :-)

- **U - Unexpected** - grab the attention where nobody's seeing it coming

- **C - Concrete** - paint a mental picture of something tangible, real.

- **C - Credible** - get people to see for themselves, or through the ones they respect

- **E - Emotional** - people relate to emotions, they remember them, they care about others

- **S - Stories** - a good story is worth everything, a good story conveys, sells, is remembered...

- **S - Should** you get this book? Of course!

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to communicate something to someone. Who needs to sell or convince... as with [Switch](http://michaelnozbe.com/book-review-switch-by-heath-brothers-a-positi), this book is relevant both to the business and to the real world.

_Do your ideas stick?_
