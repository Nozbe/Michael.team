# The Podcast #112 - The Pursuit of Essentialism

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss one of my favorite [books](https://sliwinski.com/reading) of all time - Essentialism by Greg McKeown ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0804137382?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00IWZ6XGA?tag=sliwinski-20) - which I read 3 times! I recently [posted my highlights](https://sliwinski.com/essentialist) from this book and it prompted us to talk about it on the show - enjoy!
