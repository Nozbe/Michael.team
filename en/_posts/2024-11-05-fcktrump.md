# New York Times warns against Trump while Harrison Ford makes a stand for Kamala Harris and democracy

Yesterday I wrote about [billionaires and their newspapers like Washington Post or LA Times](/freedom) not having the freedom (or guts) to endorse Kamala Harris. Shame on them. Today [New York Times posted a great paragraph][ny] showing why we have to get rid of Trump and aspiring autocrats like him once and for all:

## Even his allies are against Trump!

In the above [NY Times piece][ny] you can click on each link to get more information about each statement (great use of good old hyperlinks!) and apparently one of the messages really sticks out [as Bill Kristol of the Bulwark explains](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/reich-track-wrong-track):

> Nearly half of Donald Trump’s Cabinet have refused to endorse him. When Trump learned during the Capitol riot that his supporters were threatening to kill his own vice president, he said ‘so what?’ and refused to do anything to assure the vice president was safe. Republican governors, senators, and House members have all said the same thing: We can’t give Trump another four years as president.

Harrison Ford also endorses Kamala Harris:

## Bonus: Harrison Ford explains why voting FOR Kamala Harris is the right thing to do!

It's not just about being against Trump, it's about standing for the rule of law, science and governing all Americans:
