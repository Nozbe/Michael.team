# 4000+ downloads in the first 24 hours - issue #2 hits it!

It's been crazy 24 hours for the Productive Magazine! Just in the first 24 hours **more than 4,000 people** have downloaded our magazine and the response has been great so far, looking forward to more blog posts and tweets. Hope you can help us spread the word even more! When I launched #2 of the magazine, I thought it'd be cool to beat the issue #1 2x times and reach a total of 60K downloads... and although we're still far from the goal, we've beaten the first 24 hours of the first issue 4 times, as [the first issue was downloaded "only" 1K times during its first launch day](/24-hours-and-1000-downloads-later/)
