# A Productivity System starts with Inbox

This week we're launching a new [Nozbe][n] promotion and a new video course. Unlike my [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity Course][c] this one will be shorter and even more practical. It'll be mainly targeted at people who haven't really tried investing in their productivity other than trying to keep up with a traditional paper based calendar and post it notes and email for collaboration. It's time to make the process easy for them, so this new video series will be called: **Create Your Perfect Digital Productivity System** and it's launching later this week and it starts with an Inbox:

This new free video series will be divided into three parts:

**Part 1 - Inbox and Priorities** where we'll teach how to start with a productivity system by learning not to store things in the head but dumping them in a digital Inbox. 

**Part 2 - Projects and Categories** because only after we've learned how to clear our minds we can really learn to organize things into projects and categories. This is where we take productivity to a whole new level. 

**Part 3 - Collaboration** plus additional tips and tricks. This time we'll look at [how I work with my assistant](/assistant). How we share projects, work on deadlines, get things done together. 

There it is. My new free video course is launching soon so stay tuned if you want to learn how to **create Your Perfect Digital Productivity System**. [Follow me on Twitter][t] and I'll let you know when it launches. 

***Question:*** *how did you start with your digital productivity system?*
