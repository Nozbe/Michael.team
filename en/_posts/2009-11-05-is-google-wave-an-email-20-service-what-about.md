# Is Google Wave an Email 2.0 service? What about Inbox Zero?


So I received my Google Wave invite and started playing around... if you don't know what Google Wave is, make sure to [check out this great (but very long) intro video.](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html#video) So here's how Google Wave looks like:

Well it looks pretty much like Gmail (or any other email client for that matter), doesn't it?

It does, but it can do more - it can be a live chat, a product collaboration, an email on steroids, a word processor, an app container (Nozbe for Wave?) thanks to the API and widgets....

All in all, it can be a lot, it can be a new wave of productivity movement....

## ... or not :-(

I'm just not sure I like this kind of all-in-one or all-you-can-eat product.

I still haven't tested Google Wave fully, I just received my invite and started waving with my friends but the problem is, that I believe when I start using it fully... I may want to stop quickly.

_**There is just too much noise. Too many things happening.**_

Why I still prefer Email?

## With Email I have a steady workflow

As [I explained in one of my videos](/my-simple-email-setup-with-imap/), I check email, reply if it's less than 2 minutes (GTD 2-minute rule), move to "reply" folder when I want to deal with the thing later, and move other stuff to "all mail" or trash.

This process keeps me sane, [makes sure I don't live in email](/get-a-life-outside-of-email/) and have time to do other things.

I'm just afraid that after initial "wow" the Wave will not improve my productivity, or even make it worse...

_**Questions:** Have you tried Google Wave? What's your initial reaction? Will you be switching from email to Wave?_
