# My 11th Olympic-distance triathlon - why I keep loving these 3 sports and why I keep sucking at them?

Last Sunday I ran my 11th Olympic distance triathlon. Can’t believe it’s been so many. It all started after my [first sprint-distance race](https://sliwinski.com/triathlon) - back in October 2014 and **in 5 years I’ve done 11 events!** Here’s what I learned so far and why I keep doing triathlons:

### How did my last triathlon go?

Here's a short recap of how my last triathlon went:

- **Swimming must be improved** - I took it too easy, I swam slowly like it wasn't a real race - I must practice swimming longer distances using [Total Immersion](https://www.totalimmersion.net) - this event was pretty slow for me - my average speed was mere 2:20/100m and I'm sure I can do better than that if I train more...
- **Bike riding (cycling) was fun and I was pretty fast** - my average was 34 km/h on a race with a substantial hill to climb, so it's all good - I've actually figured out a way to do at least one long (50km+) ride weekly which is key to me staying in shape here. So far so good.
- **Running wasn't very good this time.** - I've had triathlons with below 5min/km average. This time it was only 5:35min/km which is not very bad, but not good enough for me to enjoy the race. I need to double down on running training to be able to really accelerate at the end of the race...

Overall, I must say that al olympic-distance triathlon (1.5km swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run) is still a pretty hard event for me. My personal best is 2h35min and my personal worst is 3h08min. So it's still an around 3-hour endurance race and even though I'm in a good shape, it's still a demanding trial. That's why I need to continue doing at least 2 races per year (one in Spring and one in the Fall) to make sure I don't lose that shape I'm in.

### Here's what I'm doing now to stay in shape

To be really honest, I'm a little overweight now. I'm good, but [5 years ago I was 66kg](https://sliwinski.com/fitness2014/) and now I'm 72kg... so I need to lose at least 4kg pretty soon. Need to crank my diet and watch my eating habits. Need to get back to the [slow carb diet](https://sliwinski.com/slow-carb-diet).

To stay in shape, my current weekly training looks like this:

- **Monday: Swim** - I like starting the week in the pool. Sometimes a [TRX session](https://sliwinski.com/fitness-for-busy-professionals-productive-show-36/) in the afternoon.
- **Tuesday: Run** or [Tennis class](https://sliwinski.com/tennis)
- **Wednesday: Bike ride**
- **Thursday: Run** again
- **Friday: Tennis** with a friend
- **Weekend: optional trainings** like TRX or a longer bike ride with my buddies. Depending on our family plans.

### Why I keep sucking at these sports?

Well, I don't suck much, but I'm not improving much as well. I just want to stay in shape. I want to keep being in shape. I don't have any other achievements in mind. And I like [trying new sports](https://sliwinski.com/tennis) and when I do, I want to have time for them. So to me the triathlon races are a way to stay in check and keep being in shape, despite [being forty](https://sliwinski.com/forty) or more.
