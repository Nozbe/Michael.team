# List of tech stuff I'm Thankful for in 2015

I have so many things to be thankful for so I really wanted to write a great Thanksgiving post but in the end I realized that [my post from 6 years ago](/thanksgiving-what-im-thankful-for-this-year/) sums it all: [family](/family/), [Nozbe][n] and [God](/catholic). So instead of repeating myself, inspired by the latest episode of [ATP](http://atp.fm) I decided to list the tech gadgets that entered my life this past year and for which I'm particularly thankful:

## [Apple Watch](/AppleWatch)

I really love wearing it. It keeps my phone on silent mode, wakes me up quietly and helps me manage notifications productively. 

## [iMac 5K](/lastmac)

After many years I appreciate again having a really powerful and gorgeous desktop computer in my home office. 

## [iPhone size "Plus"](/6pluslove)

The best computing device I know. And it's in my pocket at all times. I'm writing this post on it. And the "S" version is even better!

## [The Podcast][tp]

Not a tech gadget per se, I'm thankful for being able to talk to [Radziu](http://radex.io) in English every week “on air” and having great people regularly listen to it and find it "entertaining enough". 

## [Tesla Model X](/podcast-13)

It finally arrived! I don't have one yet (too early, too expensive) but having it launched shows hope for a fast, modern and environmentally friendly family car that isn't boring. My new dream car. I'm thankful it exists, even if not yet in my garage ;-)

***Question:*** *What are you thankful for?*
