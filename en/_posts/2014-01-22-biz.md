# I'm officially a decade-long entrepreneur and loving it!

Silently last month, I had an opportunity to celebrate my 10th anniversary as an entrepreneur. On December 15, 2003 I registered my company ["apivision.com"][4] and was officially in business. I was kinda-self employed before, as I was trying to build, hack and sell things while studying at the university, but in 2003 right after my graduation I decided to officially open up my one-man-shop business. In this post I'll share with you a few lessons I learned and why I love every minute of it and why I still believe passion is what matters to me the most.

As I already posted on my blog, [my parents](/parents) inspired me to start a company. They both are very entrepreneurial and seeing them working on their own in the post-communist Poland and seeing their freedom, ups, downs and everything surrounding entrepreneurship I also wanted to be like them.

I studied business and graduated from business school and also learned to speak several foreign languages - folks like me would start sending out CVs after graduation to the biggest companies they knew... and I decided not to. I opened up my own "Internet company" and as [Michael Hyatt][1] likes to put it, "failed my way to a success". Here's what I learned:



## There is no failure - there's only feedback

I don't remember who said it, but I love it. Just read [my company's about page][2] - I failed several times until I managed to build Nozbe and have a real shot at building a sustainable business. One of the reasons I failed before was the fact that I was trying to find a business that was lucrative... instead of finding the one I was passionate about. Being a very disorganized person and trying to improve my own time management by reading the GTD book and other blogs and information I felt motivated to build [Nozbe][n] for myself and it succeeded because I was passionate about it. I was "scratching my own itch" and it worked. Turns out there are more people on this planet that like to be productive like me :-)

## Building a business is a hard but a very rewarding growth process

I'm growing together with my company and that's the best "growth experience" ever. I started solo, built the first version of [Nozbe][n], did customer support, marketing and everything else. Only when I knew I was serious about my new product I decided to hire first two people - a programmer and a customer support person. Both are still working with me and growing with the company, too. Slowly I started hiring more, made some mistakes, made some good decisions and now we're a team of 15 and I'm getting even more comfortable to expand it even further. But unlike most companies, we're growing organically and hiring only when we desperately need a new person for a certain position.

That being said, if everything goes according to plan, this year we'll almost double our team size.

## Still working on the same product?

Nope, [Nozbe][n] is not the same. It started as a web application but now it's a [suite of apps][3] and this year we'll finally have made the transformation to a mobile-first company. It's been a big transition from us and we just have to re-invent ourselves in order to stay relevant on the market. And this is what I love about our industry. Constant challenges - it just never gets boring.

Moreover, the more I work on my product the more possibilities I see for it. It's amazing what's ahead of us and I can really imagine working on "the same thing" for many years to come. After almost 7 years of working on [Nozbe][n] I feel like I'm just getting started.

## What's next for me?

Keep growing, keep doing what I love, keep growing my team and helping them grow with me. 10 years ago when I started my company it was one of the best decisions of my life... and I can see it more clearly than ever looking at our product and our team working together for it. Life's great!
