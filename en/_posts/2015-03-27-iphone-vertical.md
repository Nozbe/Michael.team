# iPhone 6 plus. It's all about vertical space. Apple got it right while promoting it wrong...

The other day I was showing my iPhone 6 plus to a friend and he asked me about the special "horizontal treatment" of the phone. As you might know, the "plus" model, having lots of screen real estate was blessed with additional features in the horizontal layout and a bigger keyboard... Much like an iPad. And my friend wanted me to show me how cool it was... And frankly, I wouldn't know because I hardly ever use my phone in horizontal mode... Because I think the coolest thing about the plus model is its horizontal real estate! Just look at this 3-part photo:

## Even with keyboard popped up, I have more space then on the iPhone 5s

Just look at the vertical layout on the left and the two horizontal layouts on the right. Look how much screen real estate I have on my vertical iPhone. I can write and browse at the same time. It's great. 

## My keyboard in vertical is big enough to type comfortably. 

I'm typing this blog post on my iPhone in vertical mode using the 1writer app and it's really great and fast. Whereas the horizontal keyboard is too big for me and the keys used for writing are in the center of the screen so it's totally uncomfortable to type.

## I even lock the layout to vertical...

Yes, I'm using the screen lock button to make sure my iPhone screen remains vertical at all times. I love it so much. Apple was advertising the plus model with the horizontal capabilities but it's the vertical view that's most productive and efficient on this device. It's so good!

***Question:*** *How's your iPhone 6 Plus so far? Or if you have a big android device, how's your experience?*
