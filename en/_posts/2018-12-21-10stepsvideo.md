# 10 steps to Ultimate Productivity book walkthrough in just 2 minutes!

Now that my latest book is launched: “[10 steps to Ultimate Productivity](https://sliwinski.com/10stepsbook)” inspired by [my video course](https://sliwinski.com/10steps)... and as I've already published the [excerpt from the foreword of the book](https://sliwinski.com/10intro), it's time to have a look and see what the book is like (in just 2 minutes)!

## It’s a real physical book!

And no, it's not just an ebook or audiobook - it's a physical book that we've self-published and self-printed and we'll be self-shipping it to our [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) customers and whoever buys it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8394508650/?tag=sliwinski-20).

As you can see we've made sure the book is really practical:

- large font - easy to read and get back to
- lots of white space - to take notes
- practical exercises at the end of each chapter
- lots of examples from productivity experts from our book launch team
