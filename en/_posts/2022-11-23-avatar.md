## Updating my avatar for 2022 and beyond - more blue and more smiles for a better future!

About two years ago, I decided to [stop posting regularly on Facebook and Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBDJ6EkHwin/) and I announced it with a very dark avatar which I later uploaded to all my social media profiles. Recently as I started posting more regularly both here on this blog as well as on my [LinkedIn page][l], I decided to update the avatar and go for my favorite color - blue, I hope you like it:

## I'm blue, da ba dee da ba di…

I went with my blue polo long-sleeve shirt, blue background of a blue sky and blue sea, combined with my blue eyes and a smile. I hope seeing me like this will cheer you up every time. That's the goal!

## I'm blue here and on social media!

I've updated my [LinkedIn Page Profile][l] where I post the most recently. I've also updated my [Twitter][t] (even though we don't know [how long it will last](/elon/)) as well as my [Instagram][i] (where I post very rarely) and [Facebook][f] (where I hardly ever post).

From now on, I'm gonna be most active on [LinkedIn][l] and [Twitter][t]. On LinkedIn I just started a [weekly Newsletter][ln] - you should totally subscribe!

I will also post an occasional "Story" on [Instagram][i] or [Facebook][f]. But not much more.

## Why does my avatar even matter?

As I talked to some friends, the avatar picture is still pretty important as to how people perceive you. I got feedback that my black avatar was kinda dark and made me look older than I am. And when you think about it, it doesn't reflect me at all. Quite the contrary - I feel [young](/birthday/) and I am very optimistic. And despite everything [wrong in this world](/wrong/), I am very happy and thankful for [doing what I love](/5-loves). So I want my avatar to reflect that.
