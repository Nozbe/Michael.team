# 💬 Messages in a productivity app?

At Nozbe we are fans of #asynchronous communication, meaning, it's not in real-time: you do something - you get feedback later. So why did we include chatting/messaging in our app now? Because #productivity… let me explain:

## ✅ We believe in a structure: projects ➡️ tasks ➡️ comments

Our app, #Nozbe has always been about this: you organize your projects into tasks and you elaborate on details in the comments. But what if some comments are not directly related to a particular task?

## 📧 We believe in NOT using email for internal communication!

I check my email once a day as my emails come from the outside world. I exchange messages with my team all the time when I post my feedback in the comments to tasks which is where the real action is!

## 🏆 We believe in praising in public and criticizing in private

It's important to leave feedback in a comment to a task and attack the problem, not a person. But what if you want to criticize someone's behavior or just let them know you're not happy with their performance?

## 🤫 We believe in all that and used both Nozbe and Slack!

Our idealism was not real. On one hand we promoted task-based communication. On the other we still used Slack to communicate non-task related issues. It was time to address this!

## 💪 You cannot beat them, join them, but control the way you do!

Our customers wanted Nozbe to include a chat component. We wanted to stop using Slack. We realized there's a need for non-task-related communication. So we built the Messages the Nozbe way!

## 💭 We made sure Nozbe Messages promotes thoughtful comments

Our Message interface doesn't dominate our productivity app and the message field is the same as a comment field to a task. With all its power of attachments, checklists and links to tasks and projects.

## ☑️ Messages are only a complimentary way to communicate

Nozbe is still about the action-based model of organization with projects, tasks and comments. Messages are just a small part of it as a way to let the entire team communicate without a need of a separate chat app.

## 🚀 Nozbe becomes an action and communication super app!

With Messages, Nozbe has become the one-and-only app SMART business owners need to get their team and business as well as private life organized (and communicated). Check it out:
