# On October 6 '21 I am…

It’s October. It’s Fall time. The most exciting quarter of the year has started and it’s going to be really packed for me!

> Note: this is my monthly ["now page"](/now) update where I share with you what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* I’m in the middle of [Nozbe Reunion](/reunion) - it’s so great to finally be able to see everyone in person after two years apart. It’s great that everyone attending [got vaccinated](/vaccine)
* We’re preparing a major product re-focus right now making [Nozbe Teams][n] the future of Nozbe. There’s no way back!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m about to finish editing and finally launching the [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org/) - this will be my main focus for this quarter - to make the launch as successful as possible!

## …and privately:

* I’m finally getting back in shape and I signed up for an Olympic-distance triathlon. My last official race was [two years ago](/tri11) and I’m happy to be competing again!
* My daughters are growing too fast. I can’t believe how big they’ve become. I’m planning a November week-long holiday with family.
