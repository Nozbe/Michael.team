# On August 4 '24 I am…

…starting my summer August which means deep work, reading and a family camper RV trip. Need a break after quite a stressful first half of the year.

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Had to make one of most difficult decisions in my life of the CEO, by letting go of 3 people from my team. We are 15 now in [Nozbe][n].
* We just [launched Messages](/messages) and I’ve used this [opportunity to re-launch](/noofficefm-47) the [NoOffice podcast](/noofficefm) and send [Newsletter](/news-messages)
* We’ve also launched a [Migration campaign](https://nozbe.com/migration?c=michaelteam) to help people migrate from old to the new [Nozbe][n]

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’ve re-designed my [Clipboard Manager](/clipboard) shortcut and [Action shortcut](/action) and [Watch Notes](/watchnotes) - I’ll soon post updates on this blog
* I’m loving my new [M4 iPad Pro](/ipadm4) and I got the [cellular version](/cellular)
* My new [YouTube Channel](/channel) almost hit 100 subscribers and my latest video is [about virtual meetings about having coffee](/coffee) but in the summer I’m not planning to post much. Back in September.

## …and privately:

* I’ve been on a retreat with our catholic families
* I’m now on a trip with my family in an RV - Camper.
* I’m reviewing all my notes from past months… to learn something new.
