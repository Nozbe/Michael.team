# Unboxing of iMac 5K. Retina desktop, baby! - Productive! Show #95


I'm on an Unboxing spree recently. After my recent Apple Watch it's time for my new desktop computer. As an iPhone and iPad user I'm spoiled by the retina screens so it was time for me to also make my desktop screen full retina. In this video recorded on Periscope I explain why I chose this computer and how it looks like in and out of the box. Question: Do you use a desktop computer or do you prefer a laptop?
