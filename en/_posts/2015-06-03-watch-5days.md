# 5 days with Apple Watch - time is on my side

After 5 days with Apple's latest gadget I had to write this mini review. Couldn't wait. The bottom line: love it, already used to having it. Why? Here goes:

## Love the form factor

I'm wearing my wife's watch (38mm) as mine (42 mm) is in hands of our [Nozbe][n] developer who's fine tuning our [Watch app](http://Nozbe.watch) and I like how it looks on my wrist. I'm a short guy so the smaller size might be actually better for me...

## Love the watch faces 

I'm usually using Modular, sometimes switching to Chronograph and when I'm with kids I switch to... Mickey :-)

## Love the apps

Although 3rd party apps only stream what's on the iPhone, the ones I use I really like! I use mainly Nozbe to manage my task notifications and Overcast to listen to podcasts. Apple watch is a fantastic remote control for your iPhone!

## Love the messages 

The dictation works fantastically. I now reply to most of my messages via the watch. When notifications come, they're usually interactive so I can reply to a task delegated to me or view the task and its comments. 

## Love the Watch 

Love the fact how easily it became the part of my life. Now that I have it, it's become the part of my routine. 

***Question:*** *did you get your Apple watch? Do you like it?*
