# Why using a physical whiteboard helps me… think!?

🖍️ I’ve had a whiteboard in my #homeoffice for years now and even though I don’t use it daily, I love having it there for those “deep thinking” sessions.

It’s amazing to have so much real estate to write, draw, and sometimes fool around with colored pens to help myself to think.

Recently as I was figuring out the strategy for Nozbe for 2026, going back to the “drawing board” helped me order my thoughts.

Have you had a whiteboard? Do you like thinking with it? Let me know!
