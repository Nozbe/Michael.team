# WatchNotes - multiple notes on an Apple Watch!

Two months ago I posted [**WatchNote** - a Shortcut to add a simple note](/watchnote/) directly to the [Apple Watch](/applewatch/) which I use with my [Ultra](/ultra/)'s [Action Button](/action/). After using it for a while I realized I could do something much more powerful: How about viewing or editing many notes directly from my watch? Here it is:

## WatchNotes - edit and view multiple notes on the Apple Watch (and iPhone, iPad or Mac)

Get the Shortcut for free here:

### [WatchNotes][w] - version 1.0

When you open it up, you'll be able to create a new note, write or better yet, dictate, its contents and save it. Later you'll be able to easily view it on the watch and update it.

**Disclaimer: You still need an SSH account for this!** Just as with [WatchNote](/watchnote/), you need to set up [SSH account and follow my 3 steps from my previous post](https://michael.team/watchnote/#ssh-connection-to-the-rescue---if-you-have-one).

Actually, if you've already set this up, you can use the same credentials for this Shortcut. I use both of these Shortcuts with the same credentials and they don't interfere with each other.

## Main use case: adding book notes while running!

[When I do sports](/sports/) I very often listen to [audiobooks](/books). Every now and then I'd like to note something down. A thought, an idea, a paragraph… and I only run with my [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/ultra/) and [AirPods Pro](/airpodspro/) - I don't have the [iPhone](/iphone) with me.

So I just stop, hit the [Action button](/action/) and open this Shortcut and choose the book note and add my thoughts by simply dictating them! Super sweet.

## Interesting UX: note doesn't close and I can edit it again!

After I've saved my thoughts, the Shortcut doesn't close, but it stays open with this note's options visible on the watch face:

![{{ page.title }} edit](/img/watchnotes-edit.jpg)

This way when I keep running and have another idea to note down, I just tap "Edit", dictate another thought and save it and get back to running. I've realized that in a single run I sometimes stop 3-4 times to add a note and this approach of leaving the Shortcut open with selected note lets me add my ideas quickly.

Also, when I hit "Edit" the dictation starts with a new line, so I can quickly append my new paragraph or two and not mess up the previous thing I saved. These small design decisions make using this Shortcut a joy.

## When back home, I can also edit the note on the iPhone or iPad

I've added this Shortcut to the [Action button](/action) on both my iPhone and iPad (as a Shortcut widget). This way when I'm back home I can access my notes and edit them more calmly.

⌚️ Enjoy taking notes from your Apple Watch!
