…I’m celebrating 18 years of [Nozbe][n] on a weekend with my wife, as we [plan our year](/pl/wedwoje/). I’m so blessed!

> Note: this is my ["now page"](/now) where I share what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Today Nozbe turns 18 and it’s growing again. After a tough year we’re going up and to the right and I’m excited about our future!
* We finished our toughest year ever with a profit and we’ve paid all of our debts. After a few years of downturn, our app is growing.
* I’m working with a few partners on new ways to marketing Nozbe - back to the roots of true word of mouth and productivity. Instead of likes, we’re focusing on getting great customers.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* I’m remodeling my [home office](/office) yet again. I bought a Mac Mini which I’m setting up as my new “office computer”. More details soon!
* I’m making progress on my key [Shortcuts](/shortcuts), Journal 4.0 and Clipboard 2.0. I’m already beta-testing them on my [iPad](/ipadonly)
* I’m getting back to writing a lot. There will be probably new books coming from me this year!

## …and privately:

* I’ve just visited a close friend of mine who lost his wife. What a tragedy. He’s going through the unimaginable.
* On the other hand I’ll be traveling for a wedding of another friend next weekend. Life is unexpected this way.
* As I mentioned above, I’ve been dedicating time to planning this year and I’ll be traveling much more than I thought so I’m happy my [backpack](/backpack) and cables are ready.
