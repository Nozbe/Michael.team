# On January 21 '22 I am…

I’m embracing the new 2022 and the fact that I’ll be celebrating 15 years of running [Nozbe][n] on February 1. Wow, time flies!

> Note: this is my monthly ["now page"](/now) update where I share with you what I'm up to now.

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Getting ready for **15 years of Nozbe** - a special celebration, announcement and promo - 3 in 1!
* Reviewing my past year, the financials, the team performance and dynamics and much more. I’m a product guy, so it’s kind of boring CEO stuff, but at the end of the day, it’s very useful!
* Switching to a data-driven company. Getting used to making decisions based on data and tracking it in a non-creepy way.

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* Just finished [importing **sliwinski.com** blog](/sliwinski_com) to here!
* Preparing to set up launch plan for the [No Office book](https://NoOffice.org)
* Planning to blog here more regularly as a training to express my thoughts in writing.

## …and privately:

* Preparing my 2021 summary, just like I did in [past years](/yearly)
* Doing lots of bike riding with my daughters, who suddenly felt the urge to ride bikes (which I totally support!)
* Getting ready for a yearly planning session with my wife
