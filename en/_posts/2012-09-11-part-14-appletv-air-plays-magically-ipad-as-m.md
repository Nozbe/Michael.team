# Part 14 - AppleTV air-plays magically - iPad as my main computer


Over the course of my [iPad only](/ipadonly) trip I've found many other "peripherals" help me get the job done. You've seen my [iPad gadget bag](/my-ipad-only-accessories-vs-steve-wozniaks-ga) with all of my cables and stuff I take on every business trip. But there is a small (and relatively cheap) device from Apple that makes the iPad shine even more:

## The AppleTV - your external iPad only monitor

I've highlighted many times over that [having two monitors](/video-of-my-dual-monitor-setup-for-twice-the) can double your productivity and while I've stayed single-monitor only for the last few months because I enjoy "focused" productive work on a single screen of my iPad, I very often need additional screen estate. This is where AppleTV comes in.

## AppleTV - not only for shows, Netflix, Hulu and iTunes

Well, I have two AppleTVs - one in the living room and one in the bedroom - and while I use them mostly for watching movies or TV shows (and being a movie geek I'm iTunes, Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriber) I recently found a great way of using the AppleTV for much more than entertainment thanks to the magic of AirPlay.

## AirPlay on AppleTV adds more magic to the iPad

AirPlay is a technology that enables you to stream via wireless network what you're seeing on your iPad (or iPhone - and I use both). It works like magic - you watch a video clip on your iPad and you click... and "bam" - you're seeing it now on the big screen attached to your AppleTV. Whenever I show this to someone, they can't believe it. I hear lots of WOW's right there.

My favorite way of using AirPlay is streaming YouTube videos to my screen - whether they are Glee songs I found on my iPhone for my daughter or Ted presentations for myself. I prefer to watch these on the big screen - it's a totally different experience.

## Note: With Mountain Lion AirPlay is also available on the Mac, but it's a lot more fun on the iPad or iPhone.

## AirPlay and Productivity - mirroring beyond YouTube :-)

Here's how I've recently been using AirPlay to boost my productivity on my iPad (and have some fun in the process) - by doing **AirPlay mirroring** (meaning - showing exactly what I see on my iPad... on that other screen) of what I do on my iPad:

  * **Brainstorming** \- recently with a friend of mine we've been brainstorming about a project. I could quickly draw or write stuff on my iPad and we'd interact by him seeing what I was doing and correcting me on the fly. Totally better than him leaning over my shoulder and trying to see what I do on my small-ish 10 inch screen.
  * **Shopping with my wife** \- we do shopping online and when we do it, I pull out my iPad, mirror it to our screen in our bedroom and she quickly tells me what to buy when I pull out our shopping list. We do shopping like this very very quickly.
  * **Social browsing** \- same goes when I want to browse some web sites with my team or friends (or wife again) - I mirror the iPad's screen and we browse this together and comment on what we're seeing.
  * **Photo-shows** \- watching photos together, deciding which to keep and which have to go on the iPad is beyond fun. Especially that I have my entire Photostream (from my iPhone) automatically there on the iPad. Beyond cool.
  * **Keynote Presentations** \- I'll be recording some new presentations for Nozbe and our upcoming productivity course... and I'm using Keynote on the iPad and stream stuff through AirPlay to the projector screen.
  * **Seeing a bigger picture** \- sometimes I just want to see something on bigger screen to think about it. I pull it out and look at it from a slightly bigger perspective (my 42" LCD is much bigger than the iPad :-)

## AppleTV is not a toy... but it is!

If you're serious about your productivity and about going wireless, and are using iPad as I do (or even an iPhone) - make sure to get at least one of these boxes. They're relatively cheap ($99) and they work like magic.

AppleTV is fun and powerful on its own. With AirPlay it's extremely powerful and makes my day every time I use it.

_Have you ever tried AirPlaying through an AppleTV? Or maybe other device? What did you do? Did you find it useful? Or fun? Or both?_

Best regards,
