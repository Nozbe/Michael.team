# iWallet - an iPhone minimalist wallet that has been with me for the past 9 years!

When I published my [best posts from a decade ago](/2012best/) I realized that there are things I started doing a decade ago and I keep doing to this day. Like [working standing](/im-still-standing-my-latest-video-show/) or [using iPad as my main computer](/ipad-as-my-main-computer-prologue/). It turns out, that 9 years ago [I started having a minimalist wallet attached to my iPhone](/iphone-wallet/) and never looked back. Today, my [iPhone 13 Pro](/iphone13/) wallet looks like this:

## MagSafe "iWallet" by MOFT

My latest wallet is the [Snap-on Phone Stand and Wallet](https://www.moft.us/products/moft-snap-on-phone-stand-wallet-magsafe-compatible?variant=39441615781975) which is fantastic. It has much-improved [MagSafe](/magsafe/) magnets as well as a phone stand which comes really helpful for FaceTime calls and watching [YouTube videos](/yt/) on the go.

## What's inside my "iWallet"?

I carry with me only three items:

- my driver's license ðŸš— 
- credit card ðŸ’³ 
- 20 EUR bank note ðŸ’µ

That's all I need. I have my membership cards, [COVID](/covid/) passport and other things in iPhone's virtual wallet. Other membership cards are scanned in my Notes app or 1Password vault. These things are all *just in case* because I usually pay with Apple Pay for everything using my [Apple Watch](/applewatch/).

The additional benefit of having this wallet is that I can grip my iPhone 13 Pro better when I'm holding it with one hand. And this way I carry my iPhone case-less.

## My previous iWallet - the MagSafe Wallet by Apple

Previously both with my latest iPhone as well as my last year's [iPhone mini](/mini/) I was using Apple's official [MagSafe wallet](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/magsafe?fh=12b2bf%2B4667).

I discussed it in my blog post about [embracing the MagSafe lifestyle](/magsafe/).

## Earlier I was using the Mujjo wallet case

Before the era of MagSafe, my go-to wallets were cases by [Mujjo](https://www.mujjo.com). I used them on the iPhone 11 Pro, [iPhone XS](/newdevice/) down to [iPhone X](/iphonex/).

## I had a brief stint with a Sinjimoru glued-on wallet

With a double-sided tape I had briefly a glued-on [Sinjimoru card pocket solution](http://www.sinjimoru.com/products/card-pocket-solution). I had it on both my [iPhone mini](/mini/) when I first got it and I still have it on my backup [iPhone SE](/iphonese/).

## I also had a Mujjo case on my huge iPhones 6s Plus and 7 Plus

Yes, when I was still rocking the [iPhone 7 jet black](/iphone7plus-jetblack/) and *iPhone 6S Plus*, I also had a Mujjo case but it was really big:

## With the iPhone 6S I'd simply cut out a wallet from a silicone case

[I recorded a whole video about it](/iphone6-wallet/) and here's the [end-result](/6pluslove/):

## â€¦all the way back to the iPhone 5 minimalist wallet

It all started with two elastic bands, called *Quirky Crossover* which was my [first minimalist iWallet](/)
