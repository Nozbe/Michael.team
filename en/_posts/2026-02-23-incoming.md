# First day back from vacation? Clear Incoming tasks!

First day back from VACATION? 🏖️ I have only one job - to clear my “Incoming” view in Nozbe - I had almost 100 tasks there… and on Monday afternoon I have NOTHING. ZERO. ZIP. NADA.

## Incoming - all that needs my attention!

💌 Incoming view in [Nozbe][n] - are all the tasks that need my attention. It’s my ✅ task INBOX.

⛷️ So I’m back from my [skiing holiday](/skiing/) and my only objective for Monday is to clear this view. Go through all these tasks, add feedback, complete some, postpone others, plan some more…

No status meetings or reports necessary.

Monday after a week-long absence is about going through these tasks so that:

- I’m not a bottleneck
- I know what’s going on in the company
- I can be responsive to my team and really understand what’s up.

🚀 On Tuesday DEEP WORK will begin. Monday is about catching up…

And I am caught up.

The easiest transition from vacation to work mode. What’s yours?
