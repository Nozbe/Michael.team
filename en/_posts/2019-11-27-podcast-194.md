# The Podcast #194 - Trendsetters

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss [Nozbe Teams](https://michael.gratis/nozbeteams) again - this time how we had to morph from just a product company to a technology company - and the struggles we had along the way. It’s a longer one but a good one. Lots of behind-the-scenes info you rarely get from tech companies.
