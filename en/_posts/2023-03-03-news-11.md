# My 2022 review - did you do yours?

It's a tradition that [every year I post a review of the previous one](/yearly) and this year [has been no different](/2022/). What the last year was for me? ***A wind of change*** both personally and for my business:

## [My highlights of 2022](/2022/):

- War in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ started and it's still going, which made me decide to shut down sales of [Nozbe][n] in Russia completely, despite having a dedicated customer support and marketing for this market. [FCKPTN!](/fckptn/)
- My business was going slower than anticipated. We renamed **Nozbe Teams** to just **new Nozbe**, which gave us more [clarity](/clarity/) but this year I will focus on a new positioning, to improve the user adoption:
- **[Nozbe][n] is an app for small business owners that lets them get both their business and life organized in a simple way.**
- I've made significant changes in my [home office setup](/office23) by introducing the [MacBook Air M1](/ipadmac) to the mix!
- I spent **260 hours total** last year doing sports and completed my [15th olympic-distance triathlon](/tri15), which is OK but I've set up more ambitious goals for this year and changed my routines to be able to hit these goals easier.
- I've finally [shut down my old blog at **sliwinski.com**](/sliwinski_com/) and moved all my posts to the new blog at **[michael.team](https://michael.team)**
- I've done quite a few trips with my family last year, including living in an RV (camper or motorhome) for 2 weeks which was great!
- I've gone off for **3 weekend dates** with my wife last year which is very important (and fun), too!
