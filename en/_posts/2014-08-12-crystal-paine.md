# Interview with Crystal Paine "Money Saving Mom" for the Productive! Magazine No. 22

Today we're launching the summer (July/August) issue of our [Productive! Magazine](http://ProductiveMag.com/). You can browse it free or [get our free Android, iPad or iPhone apps](http://ProductiveMag.com/). Thank you!


Crystal Paine tells the story behind her MoneySavingMom.com which is one of the top personal finance blogs in the US with over 1.5 million visitors per month. She also explains why intentional money-spending and setting strict money-related rules is worth investing the time and how to compromise with your partner or spouse when it comes to managing your home budget.

Question: Are you a saver or a spender? Are you trying to "marry" your personality with the way your beloved is?

Please post your comments below, thanks!
