# What's in my Backpack in 2024/25?

Even though I've updated my travel gear list [less than a year ago](/backpack24), I've upgraded a bunch of smaller and bigger ([M4 iPad Pro](/ipadm4)) things this year, so I think it's time for yet another update. Especially that this week is a *Black Week* with lots of good prices. Especially I'm providing Amazon links with my affiliate ID so by clicking on them not only you'll see the deals but you'll be also supporting this page. Thanks and enjoy!

## Which backpack?

For a few years my go-to travel backpack has been the [Patagonia Refugio 26L][pr] model ([Amazon][pra]). I first bought a [black one](/backpack24/#which-backpacks-i-use-for-travel) but now I also added this grey-green one which has a very cool pattern. No I have two of these and I love both of them for a few reasons:

1. Big enough even for a week-long travel (more on that below)
2. Very light, only 735 grams (26 ounces) when empty.
3. Made of soft material so when not packed for a whole week it looks much smaller than it is.
4. Separate compartment for [iPad](/ipadonly) or a [laptop](/laptop)… or both.
5. TWO big stretch side pockets for water bottles, fits up to two water bottles each, or some other stuff I might need.
6. Very nicely padded shoulder straps with a sternum strap for most comfortable carry.

## What’s in my backpack?

1. [M4 iPad Pro](/ipadm4) in the laptop compartment.
2. [Peak Design Tech Pouch][pdt] ([Amazon][pdta]) where I keep all my cables, chargers and more (detailed list below).
3. [Contigo Autoseal Cortland Water Bottle][con] ([Amazon][cona]) - my favorite water bottle (also has a carabiner built in) in one of the side pockets.
4. [JBL Clip 4][jbl] ([Amazon][jbla]) Bluetooth speaker clipped and tucked in the other side pocket. Now there's a new version: [Clip 5][jbl5].
5. [Moleskine Smart Notebook][mol] ([Amazon][mola]) which I’ve been using for almost two years and still haven’t reviewed properly on my blog. I love it!
6. [Two Small Peak Design Packing Cubes][pdc] ([Amazon][pdca]) with all my clothes neatly compressed for a few days.
7. [DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro](/drone) ([Amazon][djia]) when I’m planning to record some cool drone footage.
8. [iPhone 15 Pro](/iphone15) in my pocket with a [Pitaka carbon case](/case) ([Amazon][pita]) and [minimalist MOFT wallet](/iwallet) ([Amazon][mofta]) attached to it.

This all fits nicely into my small-ish 26 liter backpack. I love it that I can travel with so many things yet with such a small backpack.

> I’m working #iPadOnly and traveling #BackpackOnly!

## How I customized and secured my backpack?

Carabiners! I bought [a bunch of carabiners][ca] and some [Lego keyrings](/lego) so that I can close my backpack securely when I’m walking in a city. This is not a sophisticated security measure but it takes some skill to open my backpack thus detracting potential thieves. It also makes sure that nothing accidentally opens.

I’ve also placed an [AirTag](/airtag) in the backpack so that I can locate it easily anytime.

## Other backpacks I’ve used and tested?

You bet. Apart from the Patagonia I’m rocking right now (and have been since 2022), I’ve used and tested and loved these backpacks:

1. [NOMATIC Travel 20L](/podcast-162/) ([Amazon][noma]) - my first backpack that started my *#BackpackOnly* journey (from 2018-2021). I still have it and use it from time to time. Well built and great expansion from 20 - 23 liters!
2. [Fjällräven Ulvö 23](/backpack21/) ([Amazon][fjal]) - very light and capable backpack. It’s been my faithful companion for at least 3 years (2019-2022).
3. [Peak Design Outdoor 25L][pdb] ([Amazon][pdba]) - OK, I haven’t used it yet but I bought it on Kickstarter and I’m impatiently waiting for it to arrive. It looks very promising!

As you can see I keep changing them as I see my needs change. There are so many cool backpacks now that everyone can find something for themselves!

## What’s in my tech pouch?

I’ve updated my tech pouch many times: [2011](/21-must-have-gadgets-of-a-road-warrior/), [2012](/my-must-have-ipad-accessories-for-the-road-productive-magazine-show-47/), [2021](/backpack21/#whats-in-my-essentials-cable-pouch), [2023](/pouch) and [early 2024](/backpack24/#whats-in-my-tech-pouch-in-2024). Today it's time for the ultimate update:

![{{ page.title }} list](/img/backpack25-list.jpg)

To see the image in full res, [click here](/img/backpack25-listfull.jpg){:target='_blank'}.

Here’s the latest list with helpful Amazon links:

1. **RoHS 100W 4-port, 3xUSB-C and USB charger** - it's not available on Amazon anymore, so today I'd get either [Ugreen 100W][uga] with 4 ports or the [Anker 100W][ank1] with 3 ports (which I have as a replacement).
2. [Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 cable][cma] for quick transfers and charging for my iPad. Although today I'd buy a [Thunderbolt 4 version][cmat4] or maybe even [Thunderbolt 5 one][cmat5]?
3. [Braided Apple USB-C cable][appc] ([Anker alt.][ankc]) and [Watch to USB-C fast cable][watch] for fast charging.
4. [USB-A to USB-C][belk] cable for when I rent a car with wired CarPlay.
5. [USB-C to Lightning Apple][appl] cable and [Apple MagSafe Duo][mg] (it's no longer for sale but I still love it - enjoying [MagSafe lifestyle](/magsafe)). Today I'd buy [this one from Kuxiu][kuxa].
6. [HyperDrive Hub Adapter 6-in-1 Dongle][hy] for both my iPad and iPhone 15 Pro.
7. [Uni USB-C to Ethernet][un] for when I need wired connection.
8. **Short USB-C to Lightning and USB-A to lightning cables** ([Amazon alternative][sca]) for when I need additional short cables. Never enough cables.
9. [SOOPII 100W 1ft USB C to USB C Cable with LED display][so] so I can measure charging speeds.
10. **Small notebooks and post-its**
11. **Small screwdrivers and a SIM popper** and **forceps** (they come very handy).
12. [AirFly Pro][ap] Bluetooth transmitter ([Amazon][apa]).
13. **Fingernail clipper** and **nail filer** (not leaving on a trip without it).
14. [USB-A to USB-C][usba] and [USB-A to USB-C][usbc] adapters and an old **Apple USB pen drive**.
15. Generic **USB-A to micro-USB cable** as these are still popular in many devices.
16. [Uni HDMI to USB-C cable][uh] to stream iPhone/iPad screen to any TV screen.
17. **Sewing kit** that they give you in any hotel.
18. **Extra propellers** for my [Drone](/drone).
19. [Moleskine Smart Notebook][mol] ([Amazon][mola])
20. [Nozbe](/nozbe) - branded Buff ([Amazon alt][buff]) for when I'm cold.
21. [Pen Loop holders for notebook][pena] for when I need them for a notebook.
22. **Charging hanger** (when charge sockets are in weird places in the hotel rooms).
23. **Waterproof iPhone cover** in case I'm afraid of submerging my iPhone too much.
24. **Shoe horn** so I can easily put on my shoes - just in case.
25. [Peak Design Everyday iPhone cover][pdi] ([Amazon][pdia]) as a more robust iPhone cover that I can attach to a bike with [Peak Design universal bar mount][pdm] ([Amazon][pdma]).
26. [AirPods Pro 2](/airpodspro) - although I just keep them usually in my pants pocket.
27. **Mini-jack cable** for my [Bose Quiet Control headphones][bose] which I take when I travel on a long flight.
28. [Lavalier microphone][la] with a generic [jack-to-usb-c adapter][lu].
29. [Leather Watch band][wal] for [Apple Watch Ultra](/ultra) (when I want to look nice).
30. **Cable for the Moleskine Smart pen** - you can only get an extra cable from the producer.
31. **Toothbrush, paste and dental floss**. Duh!
32. [MagSafe battery pack][magb] with both USB-C and Lightning cables.
33. **Eye cover** wich I got from Eva Air.
34. **Leather card wallet** where I also keep [Rolling Square AirCard][aircard] which makes my entire Tech pouch findable in the FindMy app.
35. [Peak Design Tech Pouch][pdt] ([Amazon][pdta]) that fits all the above items with flare!

In some cases I've linked to nearest closest alternative to what I have because some of the things I carry are no longer for sale. As you can see it's not only about the cables, but it's also about necessities that you want to have with you when you travel. I hope this list will give you ideas for your **Black Friday shopping** (many of these items are on sale) and especially for gifts for yourself or your loved ones, particularly when they are geeks like me.

![{{ page.title }} pouch](/img/backpack25-pouch.jpg)

I can't recommend the [Peak Design Tech pouch][pdt] ([Amazon][pdta]) enough. It's very well built and it fits all of these things like a champ so whenever I leave the house, I just toss it in my backpack and I know I've got all I need.

Have fun setting up your gear or buying gifts for the geeks in your family. Cheers!
