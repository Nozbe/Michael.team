# How I fell in love with my iPhone 6 Plus... and I wasn't supposed to enjoy it at all!

Back in September before Apple's presentation I wrote a [blog post about a possibility of switching from #iPadOnly to #iPhone6plusOnly](/iphoneonly/) - meaning that the new big iPhone was going to be so huge that you could do everything there. I was trying to ridicule the concept. I couldn't imagine getting such a big iPhone and working solely on it. Later I wrote how I'm going to "sacrifice myself" and get the new iPhone [although I wouldn't be able to use it one-handed](/one-handed-iphone/). Then the day came [I unpacked my new iPhone](/iphone6-wallet)...

I got the iPhone 6 Plus a month ago when I was on [our company][Nozbe]'s retreat. Along with it I unpacked my new iPad Air 2 and I wanted to make the iPad my main computing device for the whole week-long retreat. Well, it turned out I was using my iPhone 6 Plus all of the time and my iPad was collecting dust. Hm... I was surprised. Why was that?
 


## Because it's a completely new device. Right?

My new iPhone was so much different than the 5s it replaced. Maybe that's why I preferred to use it. After all my iPad Air was just a little better than my last year's model.

Well... There must have been more to this... I just fell in love with this device!

## Numbers spreadsheets? What???

I was taking notes on my iPhone. Editing texts from my team... And when we organized our company's billiards tournament I kept all the scores on my iPhone in a Numbers spreadsheets. I have never used this app on my old iPhone 5s...

## Editing [Productive! Magazine][]? Seriously?

After the retreat I came home and thought things would get back to normal again. 

Well, they didn't. I was showcasing my iPad to a friend the other day and I realized I still haven't configured it properly... I only used my iPad for writing longer texts... And my iPhone 6 plus for everything else.

Like I was in a cafe and was supposed to edit the [latest issue of our productivity magazine](/andrea-feinberg)... And although I had my iPad in my backpack I just pulled out my iPhone and got the job done there. After all, the keyboard doesn't occupy so much screen on this new 5.5 inch beast. 

## It was supposed to bend and be too big. Right!?

Well it's not. [I extended my pockets in my favorite jeans](http://instagram.com/p/v2sVarJ_Rx/). Now I take my iPhone everywhere in my pockets. I got used to the size and the fact that I have to use it with two hands most of the time. [I even created a wallet out of a silicone cover I got off Amazon](http://instagram.com/p/wCXJtKJ_TG/) - as shown on the photo above. And no #bendgate drama. It's perfect. [I even go running with it](http://instagram.com/p/wVuGlxp_UI/).

## Do I recommend an iPhone 6 Plus? Hell, yes.

Don't take the safe route and the smaller iPhone. Get the big one. It might not be the best phone...

## ...but it's the best pocket computer I've ever owned. Bar none.

***Question:*** *are you getting the new iPhone? Will you take the plus? Or did you already take one?*
