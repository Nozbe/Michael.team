## ✅ View All Your (or your teammate's) tasks in 1️⃣ place!

When you click/tap on any member of your team, you can see all of their tasks from all the projects you have access to, in one place. Incredibly useful during weekly reviews, summaries…

## 🔍 Filter Tasks in any Nozbe view, including Calendar!

In any view in Nozbe you can filter tasks by ANY parameter. Including advanced options like "all due tasks until tomorrow". Great for task batching!

## ❤️ Favorites section for projects… tags and more!

Not only can you favorite projects in Nozbe, but you can add almost any view to Favorites! For example, you can favorite a tag or a person. Mix it with filters, and you can have a very sophisticated "Favorites" view!

## 🛜 You can follow projects… and tasks!

Decide for yourself if you want to know about every activity in every project. To reduce the clutter, you can unfollow some projects but just follow one or few tasks to make sure you stay on top of things!

## 📆 Reminders for tasks are only visible to you!

Instead of setting a due date, you can also set a reminder for a task. This can mark a "start date" for you. Even better, you can set reminder on tasks you've delegated to others to not forget to check on them later!

## 🔁 Advanced Custom Repetition is there!

Some tasks need to be done every week or every other week… but some every first Monday of a month or every Tuesday and Thursday. In Nozbe you can specify your recurrence scheme the way you want!

## 🤝 Share a task with someone who's not in a project

You have a secret project with few people but want to delegate ONE task from it to another teammate? No problem! They will receive ONLY this task and will not have access to the other tasks in this project.

## 💌 Email (forward) tasks to Nozbe

Every project in Nozbe has a unique email address. You can forward your newsletters or get email notifications from other apps directly into Nozbe and automagically convert them to tasks!

## 💪 Nozbe has many hidden quirks and features that will make you and your team more productive!
