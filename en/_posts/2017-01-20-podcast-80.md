## Show notes for this episode:

**Takeaways:**

  * Forget about talent. Skills develop through practice.
  * … _a lot_ of practice (thousands of hours for expertise in most fields)
  * Focus on one small sub-skill at a time, not all of it
  * Create a tight feedback loop and iterate on those sub-skills
  * Stay just beyond your current limit of ability
  * Build mental models!
