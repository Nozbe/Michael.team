## 1️⃣ One app for projects, tasks, comments and… messages!

Get everything organized in projects 🗄️, not folders, create tasks ✅ not files, and add comments to them 💬 instead of sending each other emails!

## ✉️ Why is email so bad for collaboration?

Email does not organize work, but only multiplies the same content many times over! And still you don't know whether everyone got this message, where is the latest version and who is responsible for what.

## ❓ Instead of asking about status, KNOW the status!

If you want to know how's a project going, open it in Nozbe, instead of sending an email asking about the status. If you want to help someone with a task, add a comment to it. Simple.

## 🤝 Create projects and tasks with team members. Together!

If a task is missing, you can add it yourself and assign it to someone. Everyone on your team will have an agency to do that. Thanks to this, you can iron out the details without additional meetings.

## 🙅‍♂️ No more unnecessary meetings, more time for real work!

As everything is written down in projects, tasks and comments, there is no point in calling meetings to figure out what is going on. Everyone can see it clearly in Nozbe!

## 🔍 Find the right project, task or document!

Instead of searching through 10 apps, just search Nozbe and you will quickly find where the offer is and which one is the latest version. With Nozbe you will be able to sell more, faster and better!

## 💰 How much does Nozbe cost? Less than an hourly rate!

Double everyone's productivity, get rid of chaos or stress, and regain the sense of control. All this will cost you less than one hour of your work, and will pay off in as you gain a lot of hours every week.

## ✅ Set up Nozbe in less than 5 minutes and start today!
