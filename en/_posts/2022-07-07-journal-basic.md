# Start journaling today with this simple (and free) Siri Shortcut!

**Start regular journaling today!** I've been [journaling daily since 2016](/journal/) and over the years I've tweaked my system. I posted my most advanced version of [journaling workflow using Siri Shortcuts and iA Writer](/journal20/) over a year ago. However, as I recently prepared a more [basic Journaling Shortcut in Polish](/pl/dziennik/) for my monthly column at the [iMagazine](/imagazine/), today I'm sharing with you all the **English version of the basic Journaling Shortcut**. It doesn't require any additional app. Only Siri Shortcuts which comes with every iOS or macOS now. Just get the shortcut and start journaling today:

## Journal Basic with Siri Shortcuts

You can add this Shortcut for free to your Shortcuts library:

### [Journal Basic][jb]

Once you've added this Shortcut, open it up and you'll be guided through the following steps:

* Goals - you'll see your goals
* Choose your date - default is today
* Choose a journal entry - morning or evening entry
* Answer questions depending on the entry
* Shortcut saves your journal entry in a [Markdown file](/markdown/): `YEAR.md` in your Shortcuts iCloud folder
* That's it!

## Why different entries for morning and evening?

[As I wrote in more detail before](/journal20/) **Morning entry is focused on gratitude**. It asks me to write what Iâ€™m thankful for that happened the day before, which opportunity and also something small. After that, it asks me the focusing question: whatâ€™s the one thing I should do on this day such that everything else is easier or unnecessary. **Evening entry is focused on wrapping up the day**. It asks me what was awesome today, which sport I practiced and what I could have done better.

Anyway, if you need more in-depth information on the background of me coming up with these two journaling routines, please [read my post from 2016 where I explain in detail how I got here](/journal16/).
