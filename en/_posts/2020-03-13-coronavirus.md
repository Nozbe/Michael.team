# Special policy for Nozbe team as the COVID-19 takes over the world

As the "Corona virus", known as "COVID-19", brings the world to a halt, I'm introducing a special policy for [Nozbe][n] team members. We all work from home, so there's no problem with us doing "social distancing" but half of my team has kids. And the kids stay at home, too. And I want my team members have time for their kids, too:

## We already work from home... but kids need home-schooling!

I have [three daughters](/about) and I will have to change my works schedule to help them do their homework. Half of my team will do the same, so what I'm saying is this:

> Family comes first, work comes second. Duh!

It's easy:

1. People who don't have kids, will just work normally. Not more, not less. Just as they've always been working
2. People who have kids, attend to them first, and work when they can. If they can work 8 hours, that's amazing, if 6, 4 or less... no problem. Just work when you can, and make sure you're there for your family.

This requires lots of solidariy from the entire [Nozbe][n] team. But this is one of our core values. We take care of each other. We understand how unique and strange this situation is. And we'll get through it together.
