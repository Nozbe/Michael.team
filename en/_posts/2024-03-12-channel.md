## Subscribe to my new "Michael Team" YouTube Channel for daily productivity tips and tricks - my first 10 videos!

I've been on and off YouTube for a long time. I've had my [Productive! Show](/show/) back in the day when I was running [Productive! Magazine](/magazine/), but I never stuck to it. Our official [Nozbe YouTube Channel][ny] is OK, but my team finally convinced me to try posting "Shorts/Reels" on both my [Instagram][i] and my new [**@MichaelTeam** YouTube Channel][y] and after more than a week here are the 10 videos I posted (and first comes the channel trailer):
