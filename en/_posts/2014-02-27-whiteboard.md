# Why you should get a whiteboard? - Productive!Show #65


I recently bought a big Whiteboard to be able to draw things freely and brainstorm. In this new episode of the Productive Show I'll show you two main reasons to use a whiteboard and why and how it improves my productivity. I also mention that whenever I've drawn something in the whiteboard I take pictures of it with the Evernote app. The cool thing about it is that Nozbe syncs with Evernote so I can attach my Evernote note with whiteboard picture to a task in Nozbe as a comment. Neat, right? Anyway. I love my whiteboard. Hope you'll find my video useful :-) Question: *Do you have a whiteboard? How do you use it?*
