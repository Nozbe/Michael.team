# The Podcast #81 - Deliberate Practice

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discussed what we've learned from the book **Peak** by Anders Ericsson
( [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B01F4D6XKI?tag=sliwinski-20), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0544456238?tag=sliwinski-20))
and we dive deeper to explain the concept of "deliberate practice" with examples from our daily lives. It's a really important episode for us as it explains concepts that will be repeated throughout the next episodes of our podcast, so take your time to listen - it's only half an hour but it's worth it:
