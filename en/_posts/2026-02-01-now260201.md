## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* 🎂 Can you believe that I’ve been running the same business for 19 years now? If you are a customer - thanks for the privilege of serving you all these years 🙏
* 😍 To celebrate we sponsored the cover of [iMagazine](/imagazine) and donated a substantial sum to a foundation helping kids with cancer. See the cover below. 👇
* 🤖I’m hosting [Webinar: Nozbe.ai](https://nozbe.ai/) on Tuesday, February 10 - what better way to celebrate 19 years than launching AI features?!

## …also:

* 🗓️ I just published my [2025 summary](/2025/) - this one starts pretty dark …
* 📣 I’ve been posting more regularly on LinkedIn - feel free to [connect with me there](https://michael.gratis/in). About to cross 3k followers!

## …and privately:

* ❤️ I’m on my date weekend with my wife and we’re planning our family travels for this year. Exciting!
* 🛋️ I’m about to build a new Lego set which I got for Christmas!
* I’m finally reading *Jane Eyre* novel. I’ve seen two movie adaptations but have never read it. And it’s a classic!
