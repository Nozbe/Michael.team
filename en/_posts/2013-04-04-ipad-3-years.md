# It's been only three years since unveiling and now it's my main machine: The iPad

John Gruber linked to this article today - his initial impressions of the first iPad. It's hard not to see the post-PC era there. After just three years iPad has revolutionized the PC industry. Apple is selling more iPads than any other PC manufacturer its entire PC lineup. It's mind-blowing to say the least. **[Daring Fireball: The iPad](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad)**

## Three years inâ€¦

And I'm typing this on my iPad. For almost a year now the iPad has been my only machine - I've been working on it more than 80% of my time for the last year... and I actually got rid of my MacBook Air... my beloved Air... in the process.

And now I'm writing an [#iPadOnly](https://ipadonly.com) book with a good friend of mine. More details soon, but I think you're going to love it.

> Three years. New post-PC era. Wow.
