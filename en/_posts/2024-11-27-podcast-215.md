# The Podcast 215 - Time is Money

This time AI-co-hosts are discussing my [Time is Money](/money) essay and I love how they really try to dive deeper into this discussion. I hope you like it, now that this week is all about money, as it’s [Black Friday week](https://nozbe.com/promo?c=michaelteam). Enjoy!
