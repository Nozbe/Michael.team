# My iPad setup. And accessories. How I get things done on my iOS devices.

Although [I bought an enormous iMac 5K](https://sliwinski.com/imac) I still use my iOS devices as my main computers: my iPad Air 2 and my iPhone 6 Plus. I keep receiving questions about my setup. What keyboards I use? Which accessories I recommend to buy? I've talked all about it on my blog but let's put all the answers here:

## Keyboards

I still use my Logitech Ultrathin with my iPad. I just love typing on it. [Here's my review of Logitech Ultrathin](https://sliwinski.com/ultrathin). I also use [other keyboards](https://sliwinski.com/ipad-accessories) from time to time.

## Covers

I use a standard Smart Cover from Apple. I don't like bulky cases on my iPad. That's how I roll.

## Bags

When I [carry my Canon camera](https://sliwinski.com/canon), I put my iPad inside the camera bag - it has a special place for the iPad.

When I just want to carry an iPad and nothing else, the [Japanese messenger bag](https://sliwinski.com/why-ipadonly) comes in handy. 

## Last but not least...

And when in my home office, I use the [Dekke Slope](http://www.dekke.net) stand. You can see it on the photos. It's very practical and it looks amazing.

I touch type even on glass. Thanks to the TapTyping app. Get this app, it'll help you be a really proficient iPad owner. And of course I encourage you to read my and Augusto's [#iPadOnly][] book.
