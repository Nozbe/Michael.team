# Power of e-readers and audiobooks - productivity for the impatient

The [Productive Magazine](http://productivemagazine.com) is almost ready, we'll be compiling it this week, and we'll be working on an iPhone friendly version too. When talking about the magazine, [someone asked me](http://michaelnozbe.com/getting-the-productive-magazine-ready-finally) about my take on Productivity and e-readers (kindle, ebooks, audio) and my usage of those. Here goes:

## My iPhone is my ultimate "reading" device and I love it

I don't have a Kindle, I don't have an iPad (yet :-) but I have an iPhone... and here's why it's boosting my productivity and readership:

## 1) I can read anywhere, anytime

I'm an impatient person and when I'm on the move, in the car, I still try to be productive and get stuff done. I hate waiting in the lines and I need to get anything done when I can. Now that I have my iPhone connected to a 3G network with me, I can do several things:

- I read news and blogs with Google Reader

- I can read ebooks in PDF format (and Kindle if I want)

- I can read books online (I read the Count of Monte Cristo recently... and it's a very big one - all on the iPhone!)

## 2) I can listen to stuff when I'm doing something else

When I drive, I get a lot stuff done, while I have my iPhone plugged into car audio system:

- I [call people in my @Phone](http://www.productiveshow.com/2008/09/i-phone-people-in-my-car/) context in Nozbe

- I listen to [podcasts](http://michaelnozbe.com/re-discovering-productivity-boosting-podcasti)

- I listen to audiobooks

## Digitalization of content is great, I'm loving it.

I know that the book is meant to be read in a quiet environment, on a comfortable armchair, near a fireplace, etc... but guess what? While I still try to get this kind of environment, having all the content in a digital form helps me read a lot, helps me consume a lot more and learn a lot faster.

## I have the content with me in this one small device

Another thing is the fact that it's all in one device - my iPhone - my phone - so I don't have to carry anything extra to read or listen to. I have it all in this device... all of the time.

## Considering audio content even more

Since I'm going to gym more often now, travel a lot more by car and by subway, the audio content becomes my main way of consuming content now. That's why [I recently blogged about it](http://michaelnozbe.com/re-discovering-productivity-boosting-podcasti) and that's why [Productive Show](http://www.productiveshow.com/) is now available in a form of a [video podcast](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=352259932).

Currently I have an extensive list of books I want to purchase from Amazon... and I may choose the audio route instead and by them from Audible. Still struggling but the audio content makes it more probable that I'll eventually consume these books...

## Still reading old-school books, but not that many anymore...

Yes, I'm still reading books in a traditional way... but the barrier of entry is getting bigger and bigger for me there... I prefer to just grab my iPhone and read something there when I have a spare minute... rather than searching for a book, schlepping it with me and reading it when I can... 

_Question: __How do you consume books and content? Do you use mobile devices? Will you buy Kindle or iPad? Or do you still die-hard prefer old-school book reading?_
