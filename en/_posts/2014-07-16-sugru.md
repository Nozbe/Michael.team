# Productivity gadget review: Sugru - go fix something - Productive! Show #75


One of my friends suggested I tried it out to fix some things around the house. I couldn't believe how great it worked. I've used Sugru for many things now and keep coming with new ideas... it's an amazing product and enables you to be creative, productive and fix things before you decide to throw them away. Question: Have you ever tried Sugru? What have you fixed with it?
