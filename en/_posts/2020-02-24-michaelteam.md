# Launching Michael's Team Productivity Show with 13 stories celebrating 13 years of Nozbe

This year instead of blogging more I wanted to do something different and as our [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/teams) app is getting ready for launch I decided to start a new vlog/podcast focused on Team Productivity - how to get stuff done better in a team - with experience from running my own all-remote team and other teams using our apps - and to kick off I'm starting with the past by sharing the most memorable 13 stories from our 13-year history.

I'll be publishing the vlog weekly on [Nozbe Blog](https://nozbe.com/tags/michaelsteam) so make sure to subscribe to our blog or [Nozbe YouTube Channel](https://YouTube.com/NozbeCom).



## 13 stories in 13 years of Nozbe shared in this video:

1. The itch - to write my own app and help me be more productive
2. The tech - how I fell in love with dynamic web sites and the new "web 2.0 Ajax" technology
3. The launch - how it launched and how it got traction
4. The money - how we got our first 100 paying customers that voted with their wallet to support Nozbe
5. The side project - how I ran Nozbe completely on the side for the first year and when I went full time with it
6. The iPhone - how I built "iNozbe" in a week after the iPhone launched in the US
7. The iOS apps - how we built the first iPhone and iPad apps as the iPad launched
8. The sync - how our web-based strategy went to the cloud.
9. The team - how our team grew from me, 3 of us... and now 22.
10. The servant - how my role in the company changed as the CEO and founder
11. The magazine - how we ran [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com) between 2008-2016
12. The podcast - how we've decided to [start a podcast](/podcast) (and we just celebrated the [200th episode](/podcast-200)!)
13. The future - what the future holds for us and why it's tightly connected with [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/teams).
