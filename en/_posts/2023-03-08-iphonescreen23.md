# In 2023 my iPhone Mini has just ONE home screen

[Three years ago](/iphonescreen/) I published the details of my [iPhone 12 Mini](/mini/) Home Screen and I've had basically that same app layout on that Mini, later on the [iPhone 13 Pro](/iphone13/) and then on [my new Mini](/mini13). Only this year I decided to shake things up and reduce the Home Screen to just ONE SCREEN and that's it:

<!--More-->

## THREE Widgets…

The top part of the iPhone consists of just three widgets:

1. Calendar widget - so that I know what's coming.
2. Photos widget - because it surprises me every day with new photos, much like the [iOS16 Lock screen](/lockscreen/)
3. Shortcut widget that has two of [my journaling shortcuts](/journal/) (in Polish), a "Launcher" shortcut that launches some additional handy shortcuts that I might need and a "blog something" shortcut that prompts me to write something for this blog.

## FIVE folders with apps…

As I use my cute [ultra Mini](/mini13ultra) one-handed most of the time, I want to be able to reach to the apps with my thumb, so I put the apps in folders:

1. Settings - Settings, 1Password, HomeKit apps, Clock and FindMy ([as I have so many AirTags!](/airtag/))
2. Sports - Strava, Fitness, PhoneGap, and other health-related apps I use frequently together with Apple and Google maps.
3. Commerce - various banking apps, Amazon and Allegro as well as Polish ID app (mObywatel).
4. Work - [Reeder, iA Writer](/apps10/), Files app, Hey for email, Chrome as Safari alternative, Slack, Working Copy for GitHub, [Nozbe Personal][np] and Soulver (my favorite pocket calculator).
5. More - additional apps I use for listening (Audible for audiobooks and Overcast for podcasts and Apple Music), Notepad, Duo Lingo and Bible (After I took the screenshot I added [Ivory for Mastodon](/tweetbot/) to this folder).

## SEVEN apps I use all the time…

These apps I need to be able to access with one tap:

1. Messages - I use iMessage all the time!
2. Shortcuts - I have 78 Siri Shortcuts in my library and need to be able to access them easily.
3. Photos - I take lots of them!
4. WhatsApp - my main way to communicate with groups of people or with folks who don't have Apple devices.
5. Safari - the web, of course.
6. Phone - and iPhone is still, technically a phone.
7. [Nozbe][n] - the app that helps me maintain my work-life balance - where I organize my business and private tasks. BTW, I'm also the [owner and CEO](/nozbe/) of it :)

## OK, there's also a second screen!

I wasn't technically untrue. I do have just one screen with apps but I decided to dedicate the second screen to two additional widgets:

- Weather widget - which is very useful!
- [Nozbe][n] **Priority view** widget - which helps me stay focused on my tasks for the day. Plus it allows me to quickly add an additional task to the list if I want to. This widget is a very cool thing - I don't need to open Nozbe to know what I should be working on!

## So far so good - I like my minimalist iPhone Home Screen!

I really like my setup now:

- [The iPhone 13 Mini](/mini13/) which is [super fast](/mini13ultra)
- [The Lock Screen that surprises me with photos every hour](/lockscreen/)
- And just one Home Screen with apps and another [with tasks](/task)!

And what's your iPhone or Android Home Screen set up this year?
