# Aulery - how I won my first startup award

In a few days the Polish startup community will be awarding new startups [Aulery][a] - an annual award for innovation and global ambition. The funny thing is that the history of this award aligns with my history of starting and running [Nozbe][n] - because I was one of the first winners! Here's how it went down:

## It all started with [Aula Polska][ap] meetings in Warsawâ€¦

Back then I was living in Warsaw, Poland and I was regularly attending regular startup meetings. My favorite one was [Aula Polska][ap] organized by my buddies [Artur KurasiÅ„ski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturkurasinski/) and [Krzysztof "Chris" Kowalczyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofkowalczyk/) (on the photo above, awarding me with my "Auler"). As I was a lone startup owner, meeting with like-minded entrepreneurs was a treat for me.

After all, [I founded Nozbe in 2007](/interview/) and by the time it was 2009, I only had two additional part-time team members and that's it. At that time Nozbe was already a small global success and my peers from Poland were impressed that most of my users where not Polish, but American.

Anyway, back to the night of the first Aulery awards. I remember they were preparing a special meeting of Aula community in a very special venue - Warsaw Stock Exchange - and they insisted I'd come. I really wanted to go, but because me and my wife just had a new-born child, I was also juggling the life of a startup owner and dad very poorly and told them I might not make it this time.

> You must make it here, Michael. You must come!

One of the co-organizers pressured me so much (using a now-defunct Polish version of Twitter - Blip), that together with my wife we had to figure out how we'll make it happen.

I eventually came to this meeting while still not having any idea that there will be an award ceremony and that I will get one!

## Aulery 2009 for [Nozbe][n]

I was shocked and surprised when they announced an award ceremony and that they chose only 3 startups for this special award. It was me, [Mariusz Gralewski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariusz-gralewski-054a5976/) and [Ola Lazar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olalazar/). That's it. Three founders of three startups. Here's me with Ola:

## Aulery award means a lot to me, because it's an award by my peers!

I still keep this award in my [home office](/office/) after all these years as it reminds me how cool it is to be appreciated by your peers - by like-minded people who are also in the trenches of starting up their companies, trying to change the world and build meaningful products.

This award also helps me combat my inner [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) to constantly remind me that my efforts are appreciated not only by my thousands of [Nozbe][n] customers but also by my peers. Thank you and good luck to this year's winners (to be announced on December 14)!

Let's keep changing the world for the better! ðŸ’ª
