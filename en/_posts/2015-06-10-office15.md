# My Home Office 2015 renovation with Ikea's height-adjustable desk

Almost every year I'm changing the look and feel of my Home Office. As you know in [Nozbe][n] we all [work from home](https://sliwinski.com/teleworking) so my home office is actually my main office. My last major change was at the end of [2013][] with a few tweaks last year but this year I went for a bigger overhaul:

## Let's start with a stand-up desk!

I really like stand up desks. I've [used them in the past](https://sliwinski.com/still-standing-stand-up-desk-and-productivity-show-42/) and when I went [#iPadOnly][] I built a permanent stand up desk for my iPad. But I've always been tempted to get a height-adjustable desk so I could also work standing when on my Mac. Up until now these were very expensive but IKEA finally added these desks to their offer and they're pretty affordable... So when I went with my wife to shop at Ikea for things for our new kitchen, I impulse-bought this desk, which prompted the entire home office renovation series:

## Step 1 - get the desks ready

Here are the steps I took to build my new home office, I started with deinstalling my computer and its external monitor:

I started small by redesigning the space behind my back - the shelf with printer setup and document drawer, gained lots of additional space which still looks clean and nice:

Then I finally built the Ikea height-adjustable desk. I went with the basic 80cmX120cm size desk and it looks and works great:

Now I had to disassemble my previous long desk to make room for the new beast. When I did that the new desk looked perfect in this spot, right next to my [whiteboard](https://sliwinski.com/whiteboard):

## Step 2 - cable management and ambient light

After that the real work began - the fun part of putting cables in place and thinking how it all should be wired together... and adding some "ambient light" in the process:

The result of the ambient light was stunning:

And I'm really happy how my 2015 home office turned out - lots of space, lots of place to work and most of all, I can work standing on both my Mac and my iPad if I want. Here's the result in daylight:
