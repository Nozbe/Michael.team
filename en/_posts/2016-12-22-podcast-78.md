# The Podcast #78 - Underwhelming performance

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss technology, or more precisely, the new MacBook Pro 15" with Retina display that Radek just received. As the [iPadOnly](/ipadonly) guy I'm just asking questions and throwing in a comment or two, but mostly it's Radek describing his experience with the new laptop from Apple.
