# Interview with Greg McKeown on Essentialism - Productive! Magazine's last interview (issue #34)

I've been a long-time fan of the book: [Essentialism - the disciplined pursuit of less](/essentialism). I read the book twice and I wanted to have its author, Greg McKeown, as a cover interview for the [Productive! Magazine][pm] - and just we've decided to shut down our magazine, we managed to get him on - which gives us the best farewell ever - we're focusing on what's essential for us ([Nozbe][n]) and appreciate what we had and experienced with the magazine, and closing the magazine down with a double-message of essentialism:

This interview is pretty long, but it's really worth watching it - we've covered lots of topics and really nailed down the [Essentialism part](/essentialism/). You can read more about the last issue of the [Productive! Magazine on the Nozbe blog][b].

Thanks for being a part of the [Productive! Magazine][pm] - I've been running it more than 8 years now but it was the time to finish it up with a blast and focus on other ways we can do to help people get more done.

Thanks!

Your editor-in-chief of the Productive! Magazine
