# The Podcast #123 - So Good They Can’t Ignore You

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss an earlier book by Cal Newport - **So Good They Can’t Ignore You** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00995OX28?tag=sliwinski-20)) and its premise of not listening to a common piece of advice to “follow your passion”... and we compare it to the contents of my free book: [“It’s All About Passion!”](/passion) - enjoy!
