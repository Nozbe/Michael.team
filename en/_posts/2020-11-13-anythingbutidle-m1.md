# On Anything But Idle commenting on Apple Silicon M1 launch event

My good friends from [Anything But Idle podcast invited me again](/anythingbutidle/) to their show to talk about Apple-related stuff and it was lots of fun. We geeked out commenting on the significance of the new Apple M1 chip, the death of Intel and how monumental this change really is. Enjoy!
