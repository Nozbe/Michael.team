# The Podcast #13 - Dark corners of Palo Alto and Cupertino

New episode of your [favorite weekly podcast][p] about "technology, productivity tips, business, publishing, and whatever else comes to mind..." is out! This time we talk some more on Tesla's Model X, car sales and yesterday's Apple event:

As a car guy I'm especially not happy with the way the cars are being sold. That they make you study so many options instead of giving you a great car with an option to choose a color and a few key things. And even Tesla goes the same route. Anyway, please listen and let me know what you think!
