# What's in my backpack and tech pouch in 2024?

Hello and Happy New Year 2024! Today is [day 1](/day1) and I'm starting off this year with an update to my [travel pouch](/pouch) and [backpack](/backpack), now that I've upgraded my trusty [iPhone 13 Mini](/mini13) to USB-C powered [iPhone 15 Pro](/iphone15). This changed helped me to streamline my setup and get rid of many Lightning dongles:

## I'm traveling with 6 things in 2024

Here's the list of things I carry with me:

1. [**iPhone 15 Pro** in Spigen case](/iphone15)
2. [**iWallet** by MOFT with my IDs and cash](/iwallet)
3. [**iPad 13 Pro** - most versatile computer ever](/ipadv)
4. **Moleskine Smart Notebook** (review on the blog soon!)
5. [**Tech Pouch** by Peak Design](/pouch)
6. [**AirPods Pro 2**](/airpodspro) (not on the photo, because they're always in my pants pocket!)

That's it. These 6 things. I don't travel with my [MacBook Air](/ipadmac), it stays in my [home office](/office). All these things are marked with green ðŸŸ¢ numbers:

## What's in my tech pouch in 2024?

I love the [Tech Pouch by Peak Design][pd] - I've reviewed it [before](/pouch) by now it's time for an update - all the things marked with yellow ðŸŸ¡ numbers fit into this mighty pouch:

1. Small wallet for cards, business cards and stickers
2. Compact shoe spoon to help me put my shoes on
3. [L'Occitane hand cream][hc] for when they run dry
4. Forceps (they come very handy!) and extra ballpoint pen refills
5. Tiny paper notebook (still quite often I need to leave a note for someone)
6. Sewing kit (so I can mend something broken fast)
7. Extra propellers for my Mavic Mini 3 Pro drone (review coming up soon!)
8. Fancy leather wrist band for [Apple Watch Ultra](/ultra) (when I want to look nice)
9. Waterproof bag for the iPhone
10. Charging hanger (when charge sockets are in weird places in the hotel rooms)
11. [Uni USB-C to Ethernet][un] (this dongle lets me use wired LAN with both the [iPhone](/iphone) and the [iPad](/ipadonly)) - [Anker alt.][una]
12. Bose mini-jack to micro-jack cable (when I travel with [Bose QC35][bq] or [Bose NC700][bn]) - although recently I just use the [AirPods Pro 2](/airpodspro)
13. [Lavalier microphone][la] with a generic [jack-to-usb-c adapter][lu]
14. [Uni HDMI to USB-C cable][uh] to stream iPhone/iPad screen to any TV screen - [Amazon alt.][hca]
15. Cleaning cloth for screens
16. Jack-splitter for my daughters when they travel and want to watch something on their iPads with their headphones - [Amazon alt.][ja]
17. Small Phillips and flat screwdriver with SIM-card popper and safety pin (for emergency)
18. [AirFly Pro][ap] Bluetooth transmitter [Amazon][aa]
19. Fingernail clipper (not leaving on a trip without it)
20. USB Pen drive (reused an old [Apple](/apple) one) with [USB-to-USB-C][ua] dongle.
21. [Anker 10K MagSafe Power Bank][an]
22. [Apple MagSafe Duo][mg] (it's no longer for sale but I still love it - enjoying [MagSafe lifestyle](/magsafe))
23. [Cable Matters Thunderbolt 3 cable][cm] and Belkin USB-C cable which I now changed for Apple braided USB-C cable that came with my [iPhone 15 Pro](/iphone15)
24. Apple Watch 900mAh power bank which is also a charger - when I need to charge my wife's [Apple Watch](/applewatch)
25. [HyperDrive Hub Adapter 6-in-1 Dongle][hy]
26. Apple MagSafe Battery pack - when I need to charge my iPhone on the go
27. Two USB-c to Lightning cables so I can charge all these Lightning accessories and my wife's iPhone 13 Pro Max or my kids' iPads
28. [SOOPII 100W 1ft USB C to USB C Cable with LED display][so] so I can measure charging speeds
29. RoHS 100W 3*USB-C and USB charger (previously I was using the one from [Tecknet][te] but I misplaced it somewhere)
30. Two very short USB to Lightning cables as additional spares
31. Very short USB to USB-mini cable with additional USB to USB-C dongle and USB-C to USB dongle

## How I pack my tech pouch?

I put the first 10 items in the first compartment of the pouch. There's always some additional place there for something else I might need on each particular trip.

In the middle section I put all the dongles, jack cables and similar things:

In the last and most important section I put all my charging cables, charger and usb-c hub:

In the external pocket of the tech pouch I put the power bank.

## Which backpacks I use for travel?

I still have my old trusty [FjÃ¤llrÃ¤ven UlvÃ¶ 23](/backpack) but my new travel backpack has been the excellent **[Patagonia Refugio 26L (black)][pb]**. I find its size and dimensions perfect as well as the side pockets that fit all my water bottles. It also has this additional compartment for the iPad/laptop. I love it. It's very lightweight and when empty it looks really small but it can really fit all 26L of stuff inside, perfect for a week of travel:

My smaller backpack for daily use is a discontinued excellent [LEGO](/lego) backpack. I have two of these - one in green and other one in blue. When I go out on a short trip around town, I usually take this backpack and in the lower "lego" pocket I have an additional [Anker nano 20W charger][ak] with a simple usb-c cable so I can always charge my iPhone and iPad. This way I don't need my travel pouch there.

**Karabiners!** I love karabiners on my backpacks as they come handy to attach things together and as a way to close the backpack so they're not so easily opened. This way thieves will have harder time opening it when walking on busy city streets.
