# The Podcast #172 - It doesn’t have to be crazy at work

This week on [The Podcast][p] we discuss a book by David and Jason of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) - **It doesn’t have to be crazy at work** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0008323445?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/0062877089?tag=sliwinski-20)) - we love the book and agree with many of the ideas from there, but on the show we discuss mainly things we don’t agree with - here’s a teaser and below the full episode in audio:
