# What's up as of December 9

I'm in my [home office](/office):

## Working on [Nozbe][n]:

* Heading over the busiest time of the year, where people will start getting organized for a new year - now the challenge is to promote [Nozbe Teams][n] and [Nozbe Personal][np] properly.
* Just launched a new referral program for Nozbe Teams, where people can earn 25% recurring commission for recommending both Nozbe apps to others.
* Just launched Slack integration with Nozbe Teams. Soon we’ll do a webinar about it!

## …and when I can, I'm also:

* Back at writing the [#NoOffice book](https://NoOffice.org/) and I’m 75% done after I’ve written chapter 23. Now on to chapter 24 and beyond!
* Simplifying this blog structure and links. From now on posts tagged will have a simpler URL. Instead of **/tag/tagname/** it’s going to be just **/tagname/** - nice simplification. So to browse my blog posts about me being #iPadOnly, just go to [michael.team/ipadonly](/ipadonly) - neat!
* I’ve also imported [all blog posts from 2018](/2018best) to this blog. Time for 2017 blog posts now!
* Working on additional Siri Shortcuts to simplify and improve my journaling and automating more things.

## …and privately

* I’m on a [slow carb diet](https://sliwinski.com/slow-carb-diet/) again to lose weight. Also because of Advent I’m not drinking any alcohol and only 1 coffee a day max.
* Launched a new web site in Polish with daily Advent challenges for families - [Adwent Rodzinny](https://adwentrodzinny.pl) - with technology I learned while building this blog.
* Taking good care of my family: Ewelina, my wife of 15 years and my 3 daughters: Milena (11), Emilia (8) and Liliana (4)
