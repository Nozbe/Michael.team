# Digital Minimalism part 1 - fighting the compulsive iPhone checking - iMagazine column 19/03

For many years now [I’ve been writing a monthly column for the leading Polish lifestyle magazine - iMagazine](/tag/imagazine) and in the month of March I decided to start a short series on “digital minimalism”, inspired by the book with the same title by Cal Newport ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525536515?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B07LGF8TCJ?tag=sliwinski-20)) and the discussion I’ve had with my [The Podcast][p] co-host Radek in episodes [168 “Get bored”](https://sliwinski.com/thepodcast-168) and [175 “100% Buzz-free”](https://sliwinski.com/thepodcast-175).

[To read my column (in Polish), get the latest issue of iMagazine (it’s free)](https://imagazine.pl) or [just read it on my Polish blog](/pl/nowinki/).

If you don’t know Polish, apart from mentioning the book and the two podcast episodes, I also talked about other resources that help me stay sane and not give in to the compulsive behavior of checking my phone:

- [Siri Shortcut for limiting my Instagram opening behavior](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ee194175022e44a8a491514c7f5596c7)
- [1Blocker X - Adblock by Salavat Khanov](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-x-adblock/id1365531024?mt=8) that not only blocks the ads but also acts as content blocker - and I’ve blocked the majority of news sites from both my iPhone and iPad.
- I mentioned that instead of following [Golden State Warriors](https://sliwinski.com/warriors) on social media, to follow their games I subscribed to the iCal calendar of their games and [every day in the morning I launch a Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c6d541539b224598bf7d18310da49f4d) that googles “ youtube golden state warriors full game highlights” and watch the 10-minute highlights video on YouTube.

In the article I also mentioned a few tips and tricks which we discussed with Radek on [The Podcast][p] so please make sure to subscribe :-)
