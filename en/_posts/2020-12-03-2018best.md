# My best blog posts of 2018

As I launched this [new site](/new) I decided to gradually import and review all my posts from my previous blog. I’ve already imported [2019 posts](/2019best) and just today I finished moving over the posts from 2018. I’ve found quite a few gems in there.

## Lots of episodes of [The Podcast](/podcast)

First off, in [2018](/2018) I was more of a podcaster than a blogger and I recorded a total of 45 episodes (from 125 to 170!) so almost every week there was a new episode out. This weekly cadence was pretty exhausting and it might be the reason why we reduced recordings in 2019 and published our [last episode](/podcast-208) on June 16 of this year.

Anyway, in 2018 in these 45 episodes we covered lots of interesting topics. Here are the best episodes:

- We had a series of episodes about planning New Year's Resolutions: [Burst projects vs Keystone Habits](/podcast-127), [Values](/podcast-128), [Letting go](/podcast-129), [highlights of 2017](/podcast-130) and [plans for 2018](/podcast-131) and finish of the year with our [definitive guide](/podcast-170).
- We reviewed quite a few books: [Better Than Before](/podcast-133), [Profit First](/podcast-148) [(twice!)](/podcast-149), [Magic of Tyding Up](/podcast-146) and [Bullshit Jobs](/podcast-169).
- Actually in 2018 we met in person with Radek several times, which is highly unusual for us so we used these moments well to [do a mega episode showing contents of our backpacks](/podcast-162), [discuss my 6-week sabbatical](/podcast-158) and [give me great feedback for my conference speech](/podcast-145) as well as [share our best productivity tips and tricks](/podcast-139) and how [we use Nozbe at Nozbe](/podcast-141)
- We geeked out on apps we use: [Nozbe](/podcast-134), [note taking apps](/podcast-135), [traveling apps](/podcast-136)
- And Radek [discovered 3-D printing](/podcast-152) and started [nomadic lifestyle](/podcast-137)

## Events

I appeared on two English-first conferences in Poland and both recordings are available:

* I talked about [why I'm running a No Office company on Infoshare](/infoshare)
* And [which apps we use to actually run our No Office company at Mobiconf](/mobiconfvideo)
* And I [appeared on Polish national television for the first time ever!](/tvp2)

At the end of 2018 I launched my [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity book](/10stepsbook).

## Geeky stuff

It was 2018 when I first started using [GitHub for all my writing](/github) and [coding more](/code) which eventually led me to launch this very site all by myself and set up my writing environment to write [#NoOffice book completely out in the open](https://NoOffice.org/). It was also the year when I seriously started using [then-Worflows, now Siri Shortcuts](/workflows).

I wrote a review of [Apple Watch 4](/watch4), my [coffee-warming cup](/coffee), [HomePod](/homepod/), [iPhone X](/iphonex), [iPad Pro 11"](/ipadretro) and wrote a step-by-step guide about [migrating to a new device](/newdevice).

## Other conclusions

In the beginning of 2018 I wasn't blogging much, a few [rants](/goldenstate) [here](/football) and [there](/audi) but mainly I was just podcasting. At the end of the year I decided to [start writing daily](/newhabits/) and managed to create quite a few interesting posts but in the long run posting daily is not sustainable for me.

## That was fun. Now it's time for 2017!

I find lots of gems and some great ideas in the past posts, so it was lots of fun reviewing them. I'll be also re-listening to some of the past [podcast episodes](/podcast) and I hope you'll do the same. Thanks!
