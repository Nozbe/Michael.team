# My Tech Gadget of 2015: The Apple Watch

Last year brought lots of things from my favorite fruit company (Apple) into my life: iMac 5K, iPad Pro, iPhone 6s Plus, new Apple TV and an Apple Watch. And without a doubt the gadget of the year for me was the small computer on my wrist:

In 2014 I was blown away by my [gigantic iPhone+](https://sliwinski.com/6pluslove) but in 2015 I was surprised at how much I fell in love with wearing my [Apple Watch][a].

Yes, it's still pretty slow, the apps are not there yet, the battery life is rubbish... but I still love it for [communication, fitness and being a dashboard](https://sliwinski.com/applewatch-3/):

* our [Nozbe complication rocks](http://Nozbe.watch) - especially when it's zeroed out at the end of the day (see photo above) and staying on top of things with my iPhone in my pocket or even left in my home office just rocks
* fitness circles still motivate me. My [the podcast][tp] co-host even signed up for gym because of them
* talking to the wrist when calling to people is not only cool but also very practical 

At the end of the day, this gadget changed my habits and improved my life. I bought it initially out of curiosity but I've grown to love this device and I'm so used to wearing it on my wrist every day that I feel naked without it. 

***Question:*** *What's your gadget of 2015?*
