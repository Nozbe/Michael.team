# The Podcast #110 - Non-Violent Communication

This week on [The Podcast][p] we get back to discussing books, this time it’s all about effective communication, emotions and empathy and changing the vocabulary to explain to others how you’d like your needs met. It’s Non-Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1892005034?tag=sliwinski-20), [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B00TJJNSQG?tag=sliwinski-20)). Sorry for the two-week hiatus - we’re restoring our weekly schedule now! Thanks for listening and let us know how you liked this book!
