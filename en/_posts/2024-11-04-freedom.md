# Unlike you and me, billionaires are not free despite their fortunes

How is it possible, that two wealthiest people on the planet, with all the billions that they have, are not free to do whatever they want? [Elon Musk](/elon/) not only destroyed the value of my beloved social media platform, Twitter (now X), but [was jumping at a Trump rally](https://apnews.com/video/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania-attempted-assassination-of-donald-trump-assassinations-893c490bb52747af8b95a5546539e26a). [Jeff Bezos](/day1/) who owns Washington Post, blocked their endorsement for Kamala Harris. Billionaires, unlike us, are not free, because they have too much to lose.

## Freedom is my CORE value!

My company, [Nozbe][n] is being run in accordance with [4 CORE values](/nozbe-values/): **[Passion, Simplicity, Freedom and Fairness](/news-values/)**. One of them is **FREEDOM**. That's why [I don't have any outside VC investment](/investors/) and we only answer to [our customers](/compliments/), who are also free to choose to be [SMART](/smart/) and use our app.

I'm not a billionaire and I am free to serve my customers who are free to choose (or not) using my app. And I am free to vote for anyone I want. In Poland I was free to vote for the only good Donald I know, [Donald Tusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk), who unlike Trump, is a liberal and a patriot. If I was American, I'd vote for Kamala Harris, duh!

## Billionaires want to control the dictator

Donald Trump doesn't want to just be a president of the USA. He wants to be a dictator. He said that many times as he praised dictators like [Vladimir Putin of Russia](/fcktpn).

Billionaires have *more than enough* money to be able to do anything they want with it, right? Wrong. They always want more.  And they have more to lose. Elon Musk wants government contracts for SpaceX and support for Tesla. Jeff Bezos wants government contracts for Blue Origin and he hopes Trump will not be calling out Amazon anymore.

Even prominent Venture Capitalists, the likes of [Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz][t] or [Peter Thiel][jd] support Trump, because they want to be able to control him to get richer.

> [This] seems to fit the definition of “anticipatory obedience” as spelled out in On Tyranny, Tim Snyder’s bestselling guide to authoritarianism. Snyder defines the term as “giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian” before the authoritarian is in position to compel that handover.

Billionaires with all their billions should stand up to a dictator, not work with them, right? Apparently they are not free to do so.

## Washington Posts loses credibility (and subscribers) in the process… and Jeff Bezos loses face!

In the case of Washington Post the situation is particularly disturbing, because [they got a Pulitzer Prize][w] for their coverage of [January 6 insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack) and now they will not endorse a candidate who is running against the very person who caused this attack on democracy.

Jeff Bezos in the process loses credibility as well, [where he writes][j]:

> You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests. Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other. I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled (…)

Yet, at the same time [it is reported][g] that:

> Trump met with the Blue Origin chief executive officer, David Limp, and vice-president of government relations, Megan Mitchell, the Associated Press reported. Meanwhile, CNN reported that the Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy, had also recently reached out to speak with the former president by phone.

Again, he's a billionaire who has to lie openly to defend his billions. **He is not free.** Although he claims to be.

He built his image as a person who is *relentlessly focused on customer* and now he failed to follow his own advice, or as [The Verge put it][ve]:

> By spiking a presidential endorsement, Bezos has created the appearance of a conflict of interest — and in journalism, that is as bad as an actual conflict of interest because now you’ve lost the trust of your audience.

And the audience, that is The Washington Post subscribers responded, as [more than 10% of them cancelled][g1].

## Billionaires are not free, but we are!

You, me, we are all free and let's enjoy our freedom to vote for whoever we want. No biases, no business interests. And who better to explain this than John Oliver:

## Just for the record, this is how we got here…

The Daily Show explains how we got here, where once again Americans must defend democracy by voting for Kamala Harris:
