# How to work less and do more - Stever Robbins in Productive! Magazine #6


Yesterday we launched our 6th issue of the [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com/6) and this time I had a pleasure of interviewing my favorite podcaster - Stever Robbins - aka "the Get-it-done guy". I've been listening to his podcast for several months now and I'm enjoying them immensely every time. To learn more about Stever and read some very practical advice on single-tasking and getting things done, make sure to grab the latest issue of the [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com/6) - it's a free PDF so you've got nothing to lose:
