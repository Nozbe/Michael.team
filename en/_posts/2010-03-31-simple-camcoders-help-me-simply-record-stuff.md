# Simple camcoders help me simply record stuff. In HD, too.


Today I was recording a new episode of my [Productive! Show video podcast](/show/) where I was talking about the contents of the new 4th issue of the [Productive! Magazine](/magazine/) and it struck me how easy it is now to record a video in HD and have it up and running on Youtube....

## Just point, record, copy file, add headlines and publish :-)

That's exactly how much it takes to record a HD content and put it on Youtube... and this is my step-by-step process:

1. **Record video using ****[Kodak Zi8**](http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Zi8_Pocket_Video_Camera/productID.156585800) pocket camcoder that records in both 1080p and 720p. I tend to record in 720p these days. Recording using Zi8 means: pressing the "on" button. Pressing the "record" button once to start and second time to finish recording. Point-and-record :-)

2. Once the recording is done, **plug the camcoder via USB** to my Macbook Air. As the movies are stored as files on an SDHC card, copying takes just a few seconds.

3. **Import the movie to iMovie** app (part of Apple's iLife package) and set up an iMovie project. Add text labels, transitions and cut out the goofed stuff. iMovie makes it very easy for a beginner director like myself :-)

4. Click on the menu "Share" in iMovie to **upload the video to Youtube**. Fill out the details like video description and category. Let iMovie handle the rest.

5. **Presto!** After a handful of minutes the video is up and running on Youtube! iMovie even gives you the link to it.

I mean, really, it's that simple. The fact that my pocket size camera is so easy to use, that it stores videos as files on a flash card and that iMovie handles all the rest and makes editing video a breeze.

The barrier of entry to video podcasting is very low. I love it.

_**Question: **What's your camera and setup of choice? Do you publish on Youtube?_
