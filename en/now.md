This is a [“now”](https://nownownow.com/p/Wwy1){:target='_blank'} page inspired by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now){:target='_blank'}. It's a “status update“ on my life, my projects and priorities. I try to post a new update [every Friday](/tag/now/) while doing a weekly review. Here's my latest update:

<footer id="nojs">
{% assign tag_posts = site.tags['now'] %}
{% include posts.html posts=tag_posts limit=1 %}
</footer>
