I'm in [my home office](/tag/office) grounded by the “coronavirus”:

## Working on [Nozbe][]

* Just lead my first webinars in a long time - had so much fun! (watch it below!)
* Writing "product and company vision" for Nozbe
* Spreading the good word about "Nozbe Teams"
* Onboarding first customers to "Nozbe Teams"

## … and running [productivity](/tag/productivity) projects

* Finally launched my new site (this one!) at [Michael.team](/)
* I’m back to writing [NoOffice](https://NoOffice.org) book. Every day I'm trying to write at least 500 words.

## … and privately?

* [Just turned 41](/forty1)
* Keeping my family safe in this pandemic: Ewelina, my wife of 15 years and my 3 daughters: Milena (11), Emilia (7) and Liliana (3) - this time more intimately because I’m home-schooling the girls as the schools are closed!
* Had to change my daily schedule. In the morning I’m doing sports, later home-schooling and then I’m working in the afternoons.
* Almost 3 months at home without much travels... This pandemic times are crazy!
