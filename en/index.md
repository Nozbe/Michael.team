## Let's talk about your team's productivity!

I'm the founder of [Nozbe and Nozbe Teams](https://michael.gratis/nozbe){:target='_blank'} - to-do apps for busy professionals and teams, which I've been running for the last 13 years. I'm also a writer ([#iPadOnly](https://iPadOnly.com){:target='_blank'} and [#NoOffice](https://NoOffice.org){:target='_blank'}) and [serial](/podcast) [podcaster](/noofficefm).

With the launch of [Nozbe Teams](https://michael.gratis/nozbe){:target='_blank'} I'm all about "team productivity". Basically:

> **I help small teams do great things by working in a truly modern way.**

My team is all-remote and we all work from our "home offices" (just like the one pictured above) while delivering two global apps with more than 700,000 users worldwide.
