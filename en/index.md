## Hello there! Let's talk about team productivity!

I'm the founder of [Nozbe and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/){:target='_blank'} - to-do apps for busy professionals and teams which I've been running for the last 13 years. I'm also a writer ([#iPadOnly](https://iPadOnly.com){:target='_blank'} and [#NoOffice](https://NoOffice.org){:target='_blank'}) and [podcaster](https://thepodcast.fm){:target='_blank'}.

Personally I'm a husband and father of 3 girls. [Read about me and get my detailed bio...](/about/)

## What I'm up to now? Team productivity!

Now witht the launch of [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/){:target='_blank'} I'm all about "team productivity". Basically, I help small teams do great things by working better. My team is all-remote and we all work from our homes (or "home offices" as we call them, just like the one pictured above) while delivering two global apps with more than 700,000 users worldwide.
