## Hello there! You're looking great today!

This is my new site, which [I just launched](/team). My previous site [is here: Sliwinski.com](https://sliwinski.com){:target='_blank'}.

Let me introduce myself: professionally I'm the founder of [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/){:target='_blank'} - a to-do app for busy teams which I've been running for the last 13 years. I'm also a writer ([#iPadOnly](https://iPadOnly.com){:target='_blank'} and [#NoOffice](https://NoOffice.org){:target='_blank'}) and podcaster ([ThePodcast.FM](https://thepodcast.fm){:target='_blank'}).

Personally I'm a husband and father of 3 girls. Want to know more? [Read about me and get my detailed bio and more...](/about/)

## What I'm up to now? Team productivity!

I'm all about "team productivity", meaning, I help small teams do great things by working better. My team is all-remote and we all work from our homes (or "home offices" as we call them, just like the one pictured above) while delivering two global apps with more than 700,000 users worldwide.

## Want to get in touch?

[Connect with me on social media or drop me an email](/contact). But don't get offended if I take a little time to reply or answer briefly. I do read all the emails I get so thanks in advance for reaching out!

## This site is in three languages: English (this), [Spanish](/es/) and [Polish](/pl/)

I post stuff mostly here in English, but as I'm a guy from Poland, I do sometimes [write or do interviews in Polish](/pl). I also [speak Spanish](/es) and sometimes do webinars or public speaking in this language. I also speak German, but I haven't prepared a German version of this site yet.

## Find something on this site

Check out this [site's archive](/archive/) or [browse my posts by tags](/tag/). Gradually I'll be importing post from my old blog here. For now you can search only the new stuff:
